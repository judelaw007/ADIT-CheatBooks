## Understanding Bloom's Taxonomy Levels

The ADIT exam tests candidates at different cognitive levels:

| Level | Description | Key Verbs | What It Means for You |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------------------|
| **L3: Apply** | Use knowledge in new situations | Apply, calculate, demonstrate, solve | Apply rules to scenarios, perform calculations |
| **L4: Analyze** | Break down information and understand relationships | Analyze, compare, contrast, distinguish, examine | Compare options, identify differences, analyze scenarios |
| **L5: Evaluate** | Make judgments based on criteria | Assess, evaluate, justify, recommend, advise | Advise clients, recommend structures, evaluate tax positions |

**ADIT Focus**: Most questions require L4 (Analyze) and L5 (Evaluate) level thinking, with L3 (Apply) for calculations.
