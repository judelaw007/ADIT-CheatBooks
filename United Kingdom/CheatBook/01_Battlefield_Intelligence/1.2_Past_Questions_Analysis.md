**Exam Day Strategy:**
- Part A: No choice - must answer both. SRT is GUARANTEED (100%). Second question rotates between CIR, CFCs, Corporate Residence/PE.
- Part B: Choose your stronger area between corporate (Q3) and individual/property (Q4).
- Part C: Aim to be confident in at least 3 out of 5 topics to have genuine choice.

**Recommended 1-Month Preparation Mix:**
- **Week 1-2**: 45% time on Tier 1 topics (SRT, Domicile, Remittance Basis)
- **Week 2-3**: 35% time on Tier 2 topics (TP, Corporate Residence/PE, Trusts, BIR)
- **Week 3-4**: 15% time on Tier 3 topics (CFCs, CIR, ATED, Withholding Tax)
- **Week 4**: 5% time on Tier 4 emerging topics + integration practice + past papers

**Critical Insight from June 2025 Exam:**
The appearance of **Diverted Profits Tax**, **Offshore Insurance Bonds**, and **Protected Settlements** signals the examiners are introducing new technical areas. These topics have HIGH probability for December 2025!
