# 1.3 Examiner Psychology

## Purpose
This document decodes what examiners are really looking for, how marks are allocated, common student mistakes to avoid, and hidden opportunities to earn extra marks. Understanding examiner psychology is critical to maximizing your score.

---

## The Golden Rule: Examiners Reward Relevance

**Key Principle**: Examiners allocate marks for relevant points that answer the question asked, not for demonstrating general knowledge.

### What This Means in Practice:

| Student Behavior | Examiner Response | Marks Impact |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Writes everything they know about residence | Frustrated - most content irrelevant | 40% of potential marks |
| Identifies the specific residence test needed and applies it | Pleased - targeted response | 85% of potential marks |
| Adds irrelevant legislation sections | Annoyed - wastes time | No extra marks |
| Cites only relevant legislation for the issue | Appreciative - shows understanding | Full marks available |
| Writes lengthy narrative paragraphs | Difficult to mark - points buried | 60% of potential marks |
| Uses headings, bullets, clear structure | Easy to mark - points visible | 90% of potential marks |

**Takeaway**: Answer the specific question asked, not the question you wish was asked.

## Mark Allocation Patterns by Question Part

### Part A Questions (50 marks) - Detailed Breakdown

**Typical 25-mark sub-question structure:**

| Component | Typical Marks | What Earns Marks |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| **Issue Identification** | 2-3 marks | Correctly identifying the tax issue(s) to address |
| **Legal Framework** | 4-6 marks | Stating relevant legislation, tests, conditions |
| **Application to Facts** | 8-12 marks | Applying rules to scenario facts systematically |
| **Conclusion/Advice** | 4-6 marks | Clear conclusion and practical recommendations |
| **Professional Skills** | 2-3 marks | Communication, structure, commercial awareness |
| **Calculations** | 3-5 marks | Accurate calculations with clear workings |

**Example - Individual Residence Question (25 marks):**
- Identify that SRT applies (2 marks)
- State the three-test framework (3 marks)
- Apply automatic overseas test to facts (4 marks)
- Apply automatic UK test to facts (4 marks)
- Apply sufficient ties test with tie-counting (6 marks)
- Conclude residence status and timing (3 marks)
- Professional skills for clear structure (3 marks)

**Key Insight**: Application marks (8-12) are the largest pool. Don't just state rules - show how they work with the facts.

---

### Part B Questions (20 marks) - Detailed Breakdown

**Typical 10-mark sub-question structure:**

| Component | Typical Marks | What Earns Marks |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| **Issue Identification** | 1-2 marks | Recognizing the relevant area |
| **Legal Framework** | 3-4 marks | Explaining conditions/requirements |
| **Application to Facts** | 4-5 marks | Working through each condition |
| **Conclusion** | 1-2 marks | Clear answer to the question |
| **Professional Skills** | 1 mark | Structure and clarity |

**Example - Business Investment Relief (10 marks):**
- Identify BIR as relevant for remittance basis taxpayer (1 mark)
- State BIR conditions under ITA 2007 s 809VA (3 marks)
- Apply each condition to the investment described (4 marks)
- Conclude whether investment qualifies (1 mark)
- Clear structure with headings (1 mark)

**Key Insight**: Part B rewards systematic working through requirements/conditions. Use a checklist approach.

---

### Part C Questions (30 marks) - Detailed Breakdown

**Typical 6-mark sub-question structure:**

| Component | Typical Marks | What Earns Marks |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| **Direct Answer** | 1 mark | Answering the question asked |
| **Explanation/Rules** | 3-4 marks | Relevant rules and how they work |
| **Application** | 1-2 marks | Brief application to scenario |

**Example - ATED Relief (6 marks):**
- Identify which relief applies (1 mark)
- Explain relief conditions (3 marks)
- Conclude whether conditions met (2 marks)

**Key Insight**: Part C questions are often knowledge-based. State rules clearly and concisely - less detail needed than Part A/B.

---

## What Examiners Reward (How to Gain Marks)

### 1. Structured Answers with Clear Signposting

**Examiner's Perspective**: "I can easily see where candidates have addressed each requirement."

**What to Do**:
```
✓ Use headings that mirror question requirements
✓ Number points when working through conditions
✓ Use bullet points for clarity
✓ Leave white space between sections
```

**Example Structure**:
```
QUESTION: Advise whether Sarah is UK resident and the tax implications.

ANSWER:

1. UK RESIDENCE ANALYSIS

1.1 Statutory Residence Test Framework
[State the three-test structure]

1.2 Application to Sarah

1.2.1 Automatic Overseas Test
[Work through each condition]
Conclusion: [Does/doesn't meet]

1.2.2 Automatic UK Test
[Work through each condition]
Conclusion: [Does/doesn't meet]

1.2.3 Sufficient Ties Test (if needed)
[Count ties systematically]
Conclusion: UK resident / Not UK resident for 2024/25

2. TAX IMPLICATIONS OF RESIDENCE
[Address this part of the question]
```

**Mark Impact**: +10-15% compared to unstructured narrative

---

### 2. Accurate Legislation Citations

**Examiner's Perspective**: "Candidates who cite legislation correctly demonstrate they know the technical source."

**What Earns Marks**:
- "Under FA 2013 Sch 45..." ✓ (2 marks for correct citation)
- "The residence rules state..." ✗ (0 marks - too vague)
- "Per ITA 2007 s 809A..." ✓ (1 mark)
- "Section 809A..." ✗ (0.5 marks - which Act?)

**Golden Citations to Memorize**:

| Topic | Citation | Marks Available |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| Individual Residence | FA 2013 Sch 45 | 2 marks |
| Remittance Basis | ITA 2007 ss 809A-809Z | 2 marks |
| Corporate Residence | CTA 2009 ss 14-18 | 1 mark |
| PE Definition | CTA 2009 s 1141 | 1 mark |
| CFCs | TIOPA 2010 Part 9A | 2 marks |
| Transfer Pricing | TIOPA 2010 Part 4 | 1 mark |
| BIR | ITA 2007 s 809VA | 1 mark |
| Domicile (deemed) | ITA 2007 s 835BA | 1 mark |

**Mark Impact**: +3-5 marks per question

---

### 3. Application of Rules to Specific Facts

**Examiner's Perspective**: "Too many candidates just recite rules. I want to see them applied to the scenario."

**What to Do**:
```
✗ POOR: "The automatic overseas test requires not being in the UK for sufficient days."

✓ GOOD: "The automatic overseas test (FA 2013 Sch 45 para 13) requires being in the UK for fewer than 16 days in the tax year (or 46 days if not UK resident in any of previous 3 years). Sarah was present for 45 days in 2024/25 and was not resident in the previous 3 years. Therefore, she meets the automatic overseas test."
```

**Formula for Application**:
1. State the rule
2. State the specific facts from the scenario
3. Conclude how the rule applies to those facts

**Mark Impact**: +8-12 marks per Part A question

---

### 4. Clear Conclusions and Advice

**Examiner's Perspective**: "Tell me the answer. What should the client do?"

**What to Do**:
```
✗ POOR: "There are various factors to consider regarding residence."

✓ GOOD: "Conclusion: Sarah is not UK resident for 2024/25 under the automatic overseas test. However, she should monitor her UK days carefully in 2025/26 to avoid becoming resident under the sufficient ties test."

✓ EXCELLENT: "Recommendation: Sarah should limit UK visits to no more than 90 days in 2025/26 (allowing for 4 ties given her UK history) and maintain clear evidence of overseas home and employment to demonstrate non-residence if challenged."
```

**Mark Impact**: +4-6 marks per question (conclusion) + professional skills marks

---

### 5. Professional Skills Marks (Often Overlooked)

**What Are Professional Skills?**
ADIT tests not just technical knowledge but professional competence:
- Communication
- Commercial awareness
- Analysis and problem-solving
- Professional skepticism

**How to Earn These Marks (10-15% of total)**:

| Professional Skill | How to Demonstrate | Example | Marks |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------|-------|
| **Communication** | Clear structure, headings, logical flow | Use numbered sections, clear paragraphs | 2-3 per question |
| **Commercial Awareness** | Consider practical implications, timing, costs | "The RBC of £60,000 may exceed the tax saved, making arising basis preferable" | 1-2 per question |
| **Analysis** | Break down complex scenarios, identify issues | "Three separate issues arise: residence, PE, and withholding tax" | 1-2 per question |
| **Professional Skepticism** | Question assumptions, identify risks | "The company claims CMC is overseas, but the facts suggest otherwise" | 1-2 per question |
| **Time Management** | Answer all requirements, no blank sections | Complete all parts even if brief | Indirectly affects total |

**Pro Tip**: Professional skills marks are the easiest marks to gain with minimal extra effort. Simply structuring your answer well can add 5-10 marks.

---

### 6. Calculations with Clear Workings

**Examiner's Perspective**: "Even if the final answer is wrong, I can give marks for correct methodology."

**What to Do**:
```
✗ POOR:
Tax liability: £45,000

✓ GOOD:
UK Tax Liability Calculation:

Employment income (UK duties)          £120,000
Less: Personal allowance                (£12,570)
Taxable income                          £107,430

Basic rate: £37,700 @ 20%               £7,540
Higher rate: £69,730 @ 40%              £27,892
Total income tax                        £35,432
NIC: Class 1 employee                    £5,318
Total UK tax liability                  £40,750
```

**Mark Allocation for Calculations**:
- Correct final answer: 1 mark
- Correct methodology/working: 2-3 marks
- Proper format and labels: 1 mark

**Key Insight**: You can score 3/4 marks even with wrong final answer if working is correct.

---

## What Examiners Penalize (How to Lose Marks)

### 1. Irrelevant Content ("Knowledge Dumping")

**The Mistake**:
- Question asks about **individual residence**
- Student writes 2 pages on corporate residence, PE, and CFCs
- Student then writes 1 page on individual residence

**Examiner's Response**: Frustrated. Only the 1 page on individual residence earns marks.

**Mark Lost**: ~40% of potential marks

**How to Avoid**:
- Read the requirement carefully
- Underline key words in the question
- Only write content that directly answers what's asked

---

### 2. Stating Rules Without Application

**The Mistake**:
```
"The statutory residence test has three parts: automatic overseas test, automatic UK test, and sufficient ties test. The automatic overseas test considers days in the UK. The automatic UK test also considers days. The ties test looks at various connections."
```

**Examiner's Response**: "This is a textbook. Where's the analysis of the scenario?"

**Marks Earned**: 3-4 marks out of 25 possible

**How to Avoid**:
- After stating each rule, immediately apply it to the facts
- Use the phrase "In this case..." or "Applying this to [name]..."
- Make your answer specific to the scenario

---

### 3. Poor Time Management (Incomplete Answers)

**The Mistake**:
- Spends 60 minutes on first Part A question (should be 45 min)
- Rushes through Part B in 15 minutes (should be 36 min)
- Leaves last Part C question blank (30 min worth)

**Mark Lost**: ~25-30 marks (failed paper)

**Examiner's Perspective**: "I can only mark what's written. Blank answers = zero marks."

**How to Avoid**:
- Strict time discipline: 1.8 minutes per mark
- If stuck, write something and move on
- Always attempt every question
- Come back to incomplete questions if time remains

---

### 4. Vague or Ambiguous Language

**The Mistake**:
```
"The company might be resident in the UK depending on various factors."
```

**Examiner's Response**: "Tell me the answer! Yes or no? And why?"

**How to Fix**:
```
"The company is UK resident because central management and control is exercised in the UK, evidenced by: (1) board meetings held in London, (2) UK-based directors, (3) strategic decisions made in the UK."
```

**Mark Impact**: Vague language costs 20-30% of available marks

---

### 5. Ignoring Professional Marks

**The Mistake**:
- Writes continuous prose with no headings
- No paragraph breaks
- No structure or signposting
- Difficult to read

**Mark Lost**: 5-10 marks across the paper

**Examiner's Perspective**: "I'm searching through paragraphs trying to find the points. This is exhausting."

**How to Avoid**:
- ALWAYS use headings
- Number your points
- Use white space
- Make it easy to mark

---

### 6. Arithmetic Errors in Calculations

**The Mistake**:
- States correct method
- Shows correct working
- Makes addition error: 15,000 + 8,000 = 24,000 (should be 23,000)

**Mark Impact**: Usually costs only 1 mark (out of 4-5 for the calculation)

**Examiner's Perspective**: "Method is correct, so most marks awarded despite arithmetic error."

**How to Avoid**:
- Double-check calculations
- Use calculator carefully
- Consider reasonableness of answer

---

## Common Student Mistakes (From Examiner Reports)

### Mistake #1: Not Reading the Question Carefully

**Example**:
- Question asks: "Advise on the **UK tax implications** if John moves to France"
- Student writes extensively about French tax rules

**Lost**: 50% of marks

**Fix**: Underline key requirements. "UK tax" means focus on UK rules about someone leaving.

---

### Mistake #2: Confusing Similar Concepts

**Common Confusions**:

| Students Confuse | Reality | How to Remember |
|------------------|---------|-----------------|
| Residence vs Domicile | Completely different concepts | Residence = where you are; Domicile = home you never intend to leave |
| Ordinary residence vs Residence | Ordinary residence abolished in 2013 | Only "residence" exists now under SRT |
| PE vs Residence | Different tests, different consequences | PE = business presence; Residence = company home |
| Remittance vs arising basis | Different taxation bases | Remittance = only tax what you bring to UK; Arising = tax worldwide |

**Mark Impact**: Using wrong concept = 0 marks for that section

---

### Mistake #3: Not Showing Workings for Calculations

**Examiner's Report Comment (Actual Quote)**:
> "Many candidates wrote down a final figure with no working. Where the figure was incorrect, no marks could be awarded. Candidates should always show their working."

**Fix**: ALWAYS show every step, even if it seems obvious

---

### Mistake #4: Writing Too Little

**The Mistake**:
- 25-mark question
- Student writes 1/2 page
- Takes 15 minutes

**Reality Check**: 25 marks requires ~25 distinct points/marks. 1/2 page can't contain 25 points.

**Rule of Thumb**:
- Part A (25 marks): 1.5-2 pages
- Part B (10 marks): 3/4 - 1 page
- Part C (6 marks): 1/2 page

**Caveat**: Quality over quantity, but sufficient quantity is necessary.

---

### Mistake #5: Ignoring Mark Allocation in Requirements

**Example**:
Question has two requirements:
- (a) Explain the CFC gateway conditions [15 marks]
- (b) State the filing deadline [3 marks]

**The Mistake**:
- Student spends 40 minutes on part (a) - overly detailed
- Student spends 2 minutes on part (b) - appropriate
- Student now behind on time for rest of paper

**Fix**: Allocate time proportionate to marks (1.8 min per mark)
- Part (a): 27 minutes maximum
- Part (b): 5 minutes maximum

---

## Hidden Mark Opportunities

### Opportunity #1: Professional Skepticism

**What It Is**: Questioning the facts or assumptions in the scenario

**Example**:
> "The company states that central management and control is in Jersey. However, the facts show that all board meetings occur in London and all directors are UK resident. The company's claim should be challenged, and the true position is likely UK residence."

**Marks Earned**: 2-3 marks for demonstrating professional judgment

**How to Use**: When facts seem inconsistent or suspicious, point it out.

---

### Opportunity #2: Alternative Scenarios

**What It Is**: Showing awareness that the answer might differ if facts changed

**Example**:
> "Under the facts given, Sarah is UK resident. However, if she reduces her UK days to below 46 (given her non-resident history), she would meet the automatic overseas test and be non-resident."

**Marks Earned**: 1-2 marks for demonstrating broader understanding

**When to Use**: If you finish a question early and have 2-3 minutes remaining

---

### Opportunity #3: Practical Advice Beyond the Technical

**What It Is**: Adding commercial or practical considerations

**Example**:
> "While the remittance basis is technically available, the £60,000 RBC combined with loss of personal allowance means the arising basis may actually result in lower total tax. A full calculation comparing both bases is recommended before making the election."

**Marks Earned**: 2-3 professional skills marks

**How to Use**: After technical analysis, add 2-3 sentences on practical implications

---

### Opportunity #4: Identifying Risks or Uncertainties

**What It Is**: Highlighting areas of uncertainty or risk

**Example**:
> "The PE analysis depends heavily on whether the office constitutes a 'fixed place of business.' Given the 4-month duration, this is borderline and HMRC may challenge. Treaty provisions should be reviewed, and protective disclosure considered."

**Marks Earned**: 1-2 marks for risk awareness

---

### Opportunity #5: Citing Case Law (When Relevant)

**What It Is**: Referencing leading cases to support your analysis

**When to Use**: Common law concepts like domicile, residence (pre-SRT cases), CMC

**Example**:
> "Central management and control is exercised where strategic decisions are made (De Beers v Howe). Here, strategic decisions occur at London board meetings, indicating UK CMC."

**Marks Earned**: 1-2 marks for demonstrating depth of knowledge

**Caveat**: Only cite cases you know well and that are directly relevant. Don't force it.

---

## Examiner Mark Allocation by Question Type

### Part A: Complex Integrated Questions

**Mark Distribution Pattern**:

```
Issue Identification: 10%
Legal Framework: 20%
Application to Facts: 45%
Calculations: 10%
Conclusions/Advice: 10%
Professional Skills: 5%
```

**Key Insight**: Almost half the marks (45%) are for application. This is where most students under-perform.

---

### Part B: Technical Requirement Questions

**Mark Distribution Pattern**:

```
Understanding the requirement: 20%
Working through conditions/tests: 50%
Reaching conclusion: 15%
Structure and clarity: 15%
```

**Key Insight**: Use a systematic checklist approach. Work through each requirement methodically.

---

### Part C: Shorter Technical Questions

**Mark Distribution Pattern**:

```
Direct answer to question: 20%
Explanation of rules: 60%
Brief application: 20%
```

**Key Insight**: These are often "knowledge check" questions. State the rule clearly and move on.

---

## Marking Tolerance and Partial Credit

**Good News**: ADIT marking is generous with partial credit

### How Partial Credit Works:

| Scenario | Marks Available | Marks Typically Awarded |
|----------|----------------|------------------------|
| Wrong conclusion but correct methodology | 10 marks | 7-8 marks (70-80%) |
| Correct approach but incomplete analysis | 10 marks | 6-7 marks (60-70%) |
| Correct statement of law but weak application | 10 marks | 5-6 marks (50-60%) |
| Partially correct or one error in multi-step analysis | 10 marks | 6-8 marks (60-80%) |
| Arithmetic error but correct method | 5 marks | 4 marks (80%) |

**Key Principle**: "Follow-through marking" - if you make an error but continue correctly from that error, you don't lose marks twice.

**Implication**: Always attempt questions. Partial credit can be the difference between pass and fail.

---

## The Pass Mark Reality

**Official Pass Mark**: 50% (50 marks out of 100)

**Actual Distribution (Typical)**:
- 15-20% score 70%+ (Distinction level)
- 30-35% score 50-69% (Pass level)
- 45-50% score below 50% (Fail)

**What This Means**:
- You don't need perfection
- Focus on breadth - attempting all questions
- 60-70% on high-frequency topics is sufficient
- Don't panic if you can't answer something fully

---

**Examiner Wants**: Professional advice to a client

**Mental Model**: Senior advisor writing to partner
- Identify the issue(s)
- Explain relevant law
- Apply to client's facts
- Give clear recommendation
- Flag risks/uncertainties

**Example**: "Advise Acme Corp on its UK residence status"

---

### For "Calculate" Questions
**Examiner Wants**: Accurate calculation with clear methodology

**Mental Model**: Working paper for tax return
- Use clear format
- Label all figures
- Show every step
- State assumptions if needed
- Box final answer

**Example**: "Calculate the remittance basis charge"

---

### For "Distinguish" Questions
**Examiner Wants**: Clear comparison showing understanding of differences

**Mental Model**: Comparison table
- State definition of A
- State definition of B
- Identify key differences
- Give example of each if helpful

**Example**: "Distinguish between residence and domicile"

---

## Final Examiner Psychology Insights

### Insight #1: Examiners Are Human
- They get tired marking repetitive answers
- They appreciate clear, well-structured responses
- They want to give you marks (not trick you)
- Make their job easy = get higher marks

### Insight #2: Examiners Value Efficiency
- Concise, relevant answers score better than lengthy irrelevant ones
- Bullet points and tables are often better than prose
- Signposting helps them find your points quickly

### Insight #3: Examiners Reward Confidence
- Definite statements: "The company is UK resident because..."
- Not tentative: "The company might possibly be resident if certain factors apply..."
- Be decisive in your conclusions

### Insight #4: Examiners Test Understanding, Not Memory
- They care more that you can apply rules than recite them
- Showing working > getting perfect answer
- Understanding concepts > memorizing legislation word-for-word

### Insight #5: Examiners Follow the Mark Scheme Strictly
- Every point on the mark scheme = 1 mark
- If you make the point (even imperfectly), you get the mark
- Make as many distinct relevant points as possible
