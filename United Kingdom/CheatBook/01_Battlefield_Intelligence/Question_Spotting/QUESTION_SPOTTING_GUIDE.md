# 1.4 Question Spotting Guide

## Purpose
This guide provides a framework for predicting likely exam questions based on current affairs, recent legislative changes, OECD/BEPS developments, and examiner patterns. While no prediction is guaranteed, understanding these triggers helps you prepare strategically.

---

## The Question Spotting Framework

### The Five Prediction Signals

Examiners are more likely to test topics when these signals align:

| Signal | Description | Reliability | How to Monitor |
|--------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **1. Recent Legislation** | New or amended UK tax law in last 12-18 months | **HIGH** | Monitor Finance Acts, HMRC guidance |
| **2. OECD/BEPS Developments** | New international standards or updates | **MEDIUM-HIGH** | Track OECD releases, Pillar One/Two progress |
| **3. Current Affairs** | Major business transactions, tax controversies in news | **MEDIUM** | Follow tax press (Tax Journal, IBFD, Bloomberg Tax) |
| **4. Frequency Gaps** | Topics due to appear based on rotation pattern | **MEDIUM** | Review past questions analysis (Section 1.2) |
| **5. Examiner Hints** | Comments in past examiner reports | **MEDIUM** | Read examiner reports from last 2 years |

**The Golden Rule**: When 2+ signals align for the same topic, that topic becomes HIGH PROBABILITY for testing.

## Current Affairs Triggers

### Monitoring Real-World Tax Controversies

**Why This Matters**: Examiners often craft scenarios inspired by real-world situations (anonymized).

**Recent Triggers to Watch** (as of 2024-2025):

#### 1. **Multinational Corporate Structures**

**Real-World Pattern**:
- Tech companies with IP in low-tax jurisdictions
- UK sales functions claiming limited-risk status
- PE disputes over digital presence

**Exam Implications**:
- Part A questions on corporate residence, PE, and TP combined
- Focus on substance over form
- OECD guidance on digital PE

**Example Scenario**:
> "TechCo Inc (US parent) has UK subsidiary UKCo that employs 50 salespeople. UKCo claims to be a limited-risk distributor earning 5% return. All IP is held by Irish subsidiary IrishCo. Advise on PE risks and TP implications."

---

#### 2. **Individual Mobility and Remote Working**

**Real-World Pattern**:
- High-net-worth individuals with multiple jurisdictions
- Post-COVID remote working from UK
- PE risks from employees working from home

**Exam Implications**:
- Individual residence questions with complex day counting
- Split year treatment scenarios
- PE issues from home working

**Example Scenario**:
> "Sarah, a US citizen, worked remotely from UK for 180 days in 2024/25 while her employer ForeignCo had no UK presence. Advise on Sarah's UK residence and whether ForeignCo has UK PE."

---

#### 3. **Remittance Basis and Non-Dom Status**

**Real-World Pattern**:
- Political scrutiny of non-dom regime
- Debate over potential abolition or reform
- Increased HMRC enforcement

**Exam Implications**:
- Remittance basis questions remain high priority
- Focus on mixed funds and BIR as mitigation
- Deemed domicile interplay

**Prediction**: Even if reform rumors circulate, exam will test *current* law, but with fact patterns requiring careful analysis of remittance identification.

---

## Frequency Gap Analysis

### Topics "Due" to Appear

Based on 2020-2024 patterns from section 1.2, certain topics may be due:

| Topic | Last Appeared | Gap | Probability |
|-------|---------------|-----|-------------|
| **Trusts** (Part A depth) | Never in Part A | Large | Medium-High |
| **IHT International** | Sporadic, last Dec 2021 | 3 years | Medium |
| **VAT International** | Rare | Large | Low-Medium |
| **NICs International** | Never as standalone | Large | Low |
| **Offshore Receipts (ORIP)** | Sporadic | Medium | Low-Medium |
| **Double Tax Relief** (detailed) | Sporadic | Medium | Medium |

**Key Insight**: While gaps exist, examiners prefer high-frequency topics. "Due to appear" is weaker signal than legislative change.

**Strategy**: Be aware of gaps, but don't over-invest time. Stick to frequency-based priorities.

---

## Examiner Report Hints

### Reading Between the Lines

Examiner reports often contain subtle hints about future focus areas.

**Recent Examiner Report Themes (2022-2024)**:

#### Theme #1: "Candidates struggled with application to facts"

**Implication**: Expect more complex fact patterns requiring careful analysis
- Multi-step scenarios
- Integrated questions across topics
- Less textbook, more real-world

**How to Prepare**: Practice past papers with messy facts, ambiguous situations

---

#### Theme #2: "Many candidates did not show working for calculations"

**Implication**: Calculation questions will continue, with emphasis on methodology

**How to Prepare**: Always show every calculation step, even in practice

---

#### Theme #3: "Professional skills marks were poorly earned"

**Implication**: Structure and communication matter more than ever

**How to Prepare**: Use headings, clear formatting, bullet points in every answer

---

#### Theme #4: "Limited understanding of treaty provisions"

**Implication**: Treaty-based questions may increase

**How to Prepare**:
- Study OECD Model Articles 4 (residence), 5 (PE), 7 (business profits), 10-12 (passive income)
- Understand treaty override of domestic law
- Practice tie-breaker scenarios

---

## Prediction Framework: Step-by-Step

**Use this process 4-6 weeks before your exam:**

### Step 1: Gather Intelligence (Week -6)

- [ ] Read last 3 examiner reports
- [ ] Review HMRC What's New page for last 12 months
- [ ] Check OECD news for recent publications
- [ ] Scan tax press headlines

### Step 2: Apply the Five Signals (Week -5)

Create a table:

| Topic | Recent Legis? | OECD/BEPS? | Current Affairs? | Frequency Gap? | Examiner Hints? | Total Signals |
|-------|---------------|------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| Pillar Two | ✓ (UK implementation) | ✓✓ (Major) | ✓ (Press coverage) | N/A (New) | ? (Check reports) | 3-4 |
| Individual Residence | - | - | ✓ (Remote work) | - (Appears every exam) | ✓ (Application focus) | 2 |
| [Add other topics...] | | | | | | |

### Step 3: Prioritize Topics by Signal Count (Week -5)

- **3-4 signals**: HIGH priority - definitely prepare thoroughly
- **2 signals**: MEDIUM-HIGH priority - solid preparation
- **1 signal**: MEDIUM priority - standard preparation
- **0 signals**: LOW priority - light review only

### Step 4: Allocate Study Time (Week -4)

Don't abandon frequency-based priorities entirely, but adjust:

**Original allocation** (from section 1.1):
- 50% Critical topics (Individual Res, Remittance, Domicile)
- 30% High-priority topics
- 15% Medium-priority topics
- 5% Low-priority topics

**Adjusted with spotting**:
- 40% Critical topics (still foundation)
- 35% High-priority + spotted topics
- 20% Medium-priority topics with signals
- 5% Low-priority topics

### Step 5: Deep Dive on Spotted Topics (Weeks -4 to -2)

For each HIGH signal topic:
- Read relevant legislation/guidance thoroughly
- Find 2-3 practice questions (even if self-created)
- Prepare template answer structure
- Identify common pitfalls

### Step 6: Stay Updated (Weeks -2 to Exam)

- Final check of HMRC/OECD sites 1 week before exam
- Any breaking tax news in final days?
- Don't panic - stick to preparation plan

## Sample Predictions for 2025 Exams

**Disclaimer**: These are educated guesses, not guarantees. Always maintain broad preparation.

### June 2025 Predicted Hot Topics

| Topic | Probability | Rationale | Parts |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| **Pillar Two / Global Minimum Tax** | 75% | UK implementation 2024, major OECD initiative | A or B |
| **Individual Residence (SRT)** | 95% | Appears in 100% of exams, always relevant | A |
| **Remittance Basis + BIR** | 80% | High frequency, recent BIR guidance | A or B |
| **Transfer Pricing (Amount B)** | 60% | New OECD guidance on Amount B | B or C |
| **Corporate Interest Restriction** | 65% | Ongoing refinements, complex calculations | A or B |
| **Domicile & Deemed Domicile** | 85% | High frequency, reform speculation | B |
| **ATED** | 70% | Consistent appearance, technical detail | C |
| **Anti-Hybrid Rules** | 50% | BEPS Action 2 stable, Part C candidate | C |

### December 2025 Predicted Hot Topics

(Would update after June exam results and examiner report)

**Adjustment Logic**:
- Topics tested in June less likely in December (rotation)
- But high-frequency topics (100%, 86%) can appear both sessions
- New legislation from summer Finance Act = December candidate

---

## Brexit Considerations (Declining Relevance but Still Present)

### What's Still Relevant:

**Treaty Changes**:
- UK-EU relations for withholding taxes
- Loss of EU parent-subsidiary directive benefits
- Updated treaty interpretations

**Exam Probability**: **LOW-MEDIUM** (35%)
- Brexit transition largely complete
- Questions would be on *consequences*, not process

**Likely Format**:
- Part C: UK company receiving dividends from EU subsidiary - withholding tax implications?
- Compare pre/post-Brexit treatment

**How to Prepare**:
- Light touch - understand that EU directives no longer apply to UK
- Focus on treaty provisions instead

---

## What Topics Are UNLIKELY to Appear

### Very Low Probability Topics:

**Why Examiners Avoid These**:

1. **Brand New Legislation** (enacted <6 months before exam)
   - Insufficient time for candidates to study
   - Guidance may not be finalized
   - *Exception*: Major international developments with long lead time (like Pillar Two)

2. **Highly Specialized Niche Topics**
   - Oil and gas taxation
   - Film tax reliefs
   - Ship leasing
   - *Reason*: Not core international tax, too specialized

3. **Pure Procedural Topics**
   - Filing deadlines, penalties, payment dates
   - *Reason*: Not substantive international tax
   - *Exception*: May appear as 2-3 mark sub-question

4. **Domestic-Only Rules with No International Element**
   - UK-UK transactions with no cross-border element
   - *Reason*: Module 2.09 is international taxation
   - All questions must have international angle

5. **Topics Requiring Detailed Technical Standards**
   - IFRS accounting in depth
   - Actuarial calculations
   - *Reason*: Beyond scope of tax qualification

## Creating Your Personal Prediction List

**4 weeks before exam, complete this exercise:**

### My Top 5 Predicted Topics

| Rank | Topic | Why I Think It'll Appear | My Preparation Level (%) |
|------|-------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1. | [Your prediction] | [Your rationale] | [ ]% |
| 2. | | | |
| 3. | | | |
| 4. | | | |
| 5. | | | |

### My Study Adjustments

Based on predictions, I will:
- [ ] Spend extra 3 hours on: _____________
- [ ] Create custom practice question on: _____________
- [ ] Review recent guidance/legislation for: _____________
- [ ] Reduce time on: _____________ (to reallocate)

**Importantly**: Don't abandon high-frequency topics (Individual Res, Remittance, Domicile) even if you don't "spot" them. They appear regardless.

---

## When Question Spotting Goes Wrong

### The Risks:

**Risk #1: Over-Confidence**
- You predict Topic X will appear
- You over-prepare Topic X
- Topic Y (also important) appears instead
- You're underprepared for Topic Y

**Mitigation**: Maintain breadth. Spotting adjusts priorities by 10-20%, not 50%+.

---

**Risk #2: Confirmation Bias**
- You want Topic X to appear (because you know it well)
- You see "signals" for Topic X everywhere
- You convince yourself it's definitely appearing
- It doesn't appear

**Mitigation**: Be objective. Apply framework consistently to all topics.

---

**Risk #3: Examiner Curveballs**
- Examiner aware candidates are spotting
- Deliberately tests less-obvious angle
- Those who over-spotted struggle

**Mitigation**: Always prepare high-frequency topics thoroughly, regardless of signals.

---

## The Balanced Approach

**Recommended Strategy**:

1. **80% of preparation** = Frequency-based (section 1.2 priorities)
   - This is your safety net
   - High-frequency topics appear regardless

2. **15% of preparation** = Signal-based adjustments
   - Extra depth on 2-3 spotted topics
   - Recent legislation/OECD developments

3. **5% of preparation** = Wild cards
   - Light awareness of low-frequency topics
   - In case examiner surprises

**This approach**:
- ✓ Protects you if predictions are wrong (80% core)
- ✓ Gives you edge if predictions are right (15% boost)
- ✓ Covers unexpected scenarios (5% buffer)

---

## Final Question Spotting Wisdom

### Remember:

1. **No prediction is certain** - Examiners maintain flexibility
2. **High-frequency topics remain high-frequency** - Don't ignore the big three
3. **Recent legislation is the strongest signal** - Examiners love testing new rules
4. **OECD developments take time to appear** - But Pillar Two is exception
5. **Current affairs inspire scenarios, not topics** - Facts change, tested topics stay similar

### The Ultimate Strategy:

> **"Prepare for everything important, but be ready for anything."**

- Master the high-frequency topics (non-negotiable)
- Boost spotted topics with recent changes (strategic edge)
- Maintain awareness of all syllabus areas (safety net)
- Practice thinking on your feet with unexpected angles (exam resilience)

## Appendix: How to Monitor Intelligence Sources

### Weekly Monitoring Routine (30 minutes/week during study period)

**Monday** (10 min):
- Check HMRC "What's New" page: https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/latest
- Scan for new guidance, consultations, or legislation

**Wednesday** (10 min):
- Check OECD Tax News: https://www.oecd.org/tax/
