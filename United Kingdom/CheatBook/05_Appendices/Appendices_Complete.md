# APPENDIX 5.5: FORMULA SHEET

## Income Tax Calculations

### Taxable Income
```
Gross Income
Less: Allowable deductions
= Total Income

Less: Personal Allowance (if applicable)
= Taxable Income
```

### Personal Allowance Reduction
```
If Adjusted Net Income > £100,000:
    Reduction = (ANI - £100,000) / 2
    Allowance = £12,570 - Reduction
    Minimum = £0 (when ANI ≥ £125,140)
```

### High Income Child Benefit Charge
```
If ANI > £60,000:
    Charge = 1% of benefit per £200 of income between £60,000 - £80,000
If ANI > £80,000:
    Charge = 100% of benefit
```

---

## Corporation Tax Calculations

### Standard Computation
```
Trading Profits
+ Investment Income (NTLR, property, etc.)
+ Chargeable Gains
+ Miscellaneous Income
= Total Profits

Less: Qualifying Charitable Donations
= Taxable Total Profits

CT @ 25% (or marginal rate)
```

### Marginal Relief
```
If £50,000 < Profits ≤ £250,000:

Marginal Relief = (Upper Limit - Profits) × Fraction × (Basic Profits / Profits)

Fraction = 3/200

Effective Rate = 26.5% on profits in marginal band
```

### Associated Companies
```
Profit Limits = Standard Limits / (1 + number of associated companies)

Example: 3 associated companies
    Lower limit = £50,000 / 4 = £12,500
    Upper limit = £250,000 / 4 = £62,500
```

---

## Capital Gains Tax Calculations

### Basic CGT Computation
```
Disposal Proceeds (or Market Value if gift/connected party)
Less: Incidental Costs of Disposal
= Net Proceeds

Less: Acquisition Cost
Less: Enhancement Expenditure
Less: Incidental Costs of Acquisition
= Unindexed Gain

Less: Indexation Allowance (companies, frozen Dec 2017)
= Indexed Gain / Chargeable Gain

Less: Losses (current year, then brought forward)
Less: Annual Exempt Amount
= Taxable Gain
```

### Indexation Allowance (Companies Only)
```
Indexation = Cost × (RPI at disposal - RPI at acquisition) / RPI at acquisition

Note: Frozen at December 2017 values
Cannot create or increase a loss
```

### Part Disposal
```
Allowable Cost = Original Cost × (A / (A + B))

Where:
A = Proceeds from part disposed
B = Market value of part retained
```

### Principal Private Residence Relief
```
Exempt Gain = Total Gain × (Period of Occupation / Total Ownership)

Last 9 months always treated as occupation
Various deemed occupation periods apply
```

## Inheritance Tax Calculations

### Death Estate
```
Free Estate (assets in deceased's name)
+ Share of Joint Property
+ Gifts with Reservation
+ Trust Interests
= Gross Estate

Less: Liabilities
Less: Exemptions (spouse, charity, etc.)
= Chargeable Estate

Less: Nil Rate Band
Less: Transferable Nil Rate Band (if applicable)
Less: Residence Nil Rate Band (if applicable)
= Taxable Estate

IHT @ 40% (or 36% if charitable condition met)
```

### CLT Tax (Lifetime)
```
Gross Chargeable Transfer
Less: Annual Exemptions
Less: Available NRB
= Taxable Amount

IHT @ 20% (if donor pays)
IHT @ 25% (if donee pays - gross up)
```

### Death Tax on PETs/CLTs
```
Value at date of gift (not date of death)
Less: NRB available (considering 7-year cumulation)
= Taxable Amount

IHT @ 40%
Less: Taper Relief (if 3-7 years)
Less: Tax already paid (CLTs only)
= Additional Tax Due
```

### 10-Year Anniversary Charge (Trusts)
```
Rate = 30% × Effective Rate

Effective Rate = (Notional Transfer / Value of Settlement) × 20%

Where Notional Transfer = Settlement Value + Cumulative Transfers at creation
                          - NRB at 10-year anniversary

Max Effective Rate = 6%
```

### Exit Charge (Trusts)
```
Exit Charge = Value Leaving × Exit Rate

Exit Rate = (Effective Rate / 40) × Quarters since last 10-year / 40

Max Exit Rate = 6% of value
```

---

## Employment Income Calculations

### Company Car Benefit
```
Car Benefit = List Price × Appropriate Percentage

List Price = Original list price + accessories (>£100)
             - Capital contribution (max £5,000)
             - Price cap at £160,000

Appropriate % based on CO2 emissions (2% to 37%)
```

### Car Fuel Benefit
```
Fuel Benefit = £27,800 × Appropriate Percentage

Same percentage as car benefit
Only applies if private fuel provided
```

### Accommodation Benefit
```
Basic Charge:
If cost ≤ £75,000: Annual value
If cost > £75,000: Annual value + (Cost - £75,000) × Official Rate

Additional Charge for Expensive Accommodation:
(Market Value or Cost - £75,000) × 2.25%
```

### Beneficial Loan
```
Taxable Benefit = Loan × Official Rate (2.25%)

Less: Any interest actually paid
= Taxable Amount
```

---

## CFC Charge Calculation

```
CFC's Chargeable Profits (as computed)
× UK Company's Relevant Interest (%)
= Attributed Profits

Attributed Profits
× UK CT Rate (25%)
= Gross CFC Charge

Less: Credit for Foreign Tax (proportion)
= Net CFC Charge
```

---

## Transfer Pricing Adjustment

```
Actual Transaction Price
vs.
Arm's Length Price (using appropriate method)

Adjustment = Difference × CT Rate

Note: Adjustment only if UK tax reduced or loss increased
```

---

## Corporate Interest Restriction

### Fixed Ratio Method
```
Tax-Interest Expense
- Tax-Interest Income
= Net Tax-Interest

If Net Tax-Interest > £2m:
    Interest Allowance = Tax-EBITDA × 30%
    Disallowed = Net Tax-Interest - Interest Allowance
```

### Group Ratio Method (if elected)
```
Group Ratio = (Group Net Interest / Group EBITDA) × 100%

Interest Allowance = Tax-EBITDA × Group Ratio

Potentially allows higher deduction if group ratio > 30%
```

---

## Double Tax Relief

### Credit Method
```
UK Tax on Foreign Income
vs.
Foreign Tax Paid

DTR Credit = Lower of:
    1. Foreign tax paid
    2. UK tax on foreign income

UK Tax Payable = UK Tax - DTR Credit
```

### Exemption Method
```
Foreign income excluded from UK taxable income
(Subject to specific conditions - e.g., dividend exemption)
```
