## Mental Frameworks

### The Confidence Stack
Build unshakeable confidence through:
1. **Template Mastery**: Know your frameworks cold
2. **Pattern Recognition**: You've seen similar questions before
3. **Time Management**: You control the clock
4. **Partial Credit**: Every point counts
5. **Preparation Trust**: Trust your preparation

### Stress Management Protocol

**Before the exam**:
- Box breathing (4-4-4-4 count)
- Positive visualization
- Physical warm-up (light stretching)

**During the exam**:
- Micro-breaks between questions (30 seconds, breathe)
- Progressive muscle relaxation if tensing up
- Positive self-talk ("I'm prepared for this")

### The "Good Enough" Principle
Perfect is the enemy of pass:
- 50% to pass, not 100%
- A complete answer beats a perfect partial answer
- Move on when you've captured the marks

2. **Scan**: Read all questions quickly (5 minutes)
3. **Select**: Choose which Part A question first (1 minute)
4. **Plan**: Brief outline for first question (3 minutes)
5. **Execute**: Start writing (30 seconds to write heading)

### Question Selection Priority
1. **Confidence first**: Start with questions you know best

3. **Bank time**: Finish strong questions early to save time

### Mid-Exam Reset (After 90 minutes)

  - Calculation errors
  - Unanswered parts
  - Missing conclusions
- Add quick points where marks available
- Don't panic if not perfect

## Emergency Protocols

### "I Don't Know This Question"
1. Don't panic - you're not expected to know everything
2. Apply general principles from similar topics
3. Structure your answer properly (marks for structure)
4. Show your reasoning (marks for logic)
5. Move on if completely stuck (after 5 minutes)

### "I'm Running Out of Time"
1. Prioritize completing all questions partially over perfecting some
2. Switch to bullet points if needed
3. Focus on high-value marks (calculations, key rules)
4. Don't leave questions unattempted

### "My Mind Went Blank"
1. Stop writing, close eyes (30 seconds)
2. Deep breathing (box breathing 4-4-4-4)
3. Look at question again with fresh eyes
4. Start with what you DO know
5. Structure will help recall content
