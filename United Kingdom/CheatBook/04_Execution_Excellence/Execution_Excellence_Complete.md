```

### Time Allocation Protocol

**Official Exam Structure (June 2025 format):**

| Part | Questions | Marks | Time | Per Question |
|------|-----------|-------|------|--------------|
| Part A | 2 compulsory | 50 (25+25) | 97.5 min | 48.75 min |
| Part B | Choose 1 of 2 | 20 | 39 min | 39 min |
| Part C | Choose 2 of 5 | 30 (15+15) | 58.5 min | 29.25 min |
| **Total** | **5 questions** | **100** | **195 min** | **1.95 min/mark** |

*Note: Exam is 3¼ hours (195 minutes). Always use 1.95 min/mark for time planning.*

**Recommended Time Targets:**

| Section | Start Time | End Time | Duration |
|---------|------------|----------|----------|
| Read & Plan | 0:00 | 0:10 | 10 min |
| Part A Q1 | 0:10 | 0:55 | 45 min |
| Part A Q2 | 0:55 | 1:40 | 45 min |
| Part B | 1:40 | 2:15 | 35 min |
| Part C Q1 | 2:15 | 2:40 | 25 min |

- After 125 minutes: Part B complete
- After 155 minutes: Part C Q1 complete
- After 185 minutes: Part C Q2 complete
- Final 10 minutes: Review all answers

---

### Question Selection Logic

**Part A (No Choice - Both Compulsory)**
- Start with your stronger topic
- If equal confidence, start with the shorter scenario (faster reading)
- Don't spend more than 50 minutes on either question

**Part B (Choose 1 from 2)**
- Usually Q3 = Corporate focus, Q4 = Individual/Property focus
- Choose based on:
  1. Topic confidence (primary factor)
  2. Scenario complexity (simpler = better)
  3. Calculation requirements (prefer if you're good at calcs)
  4. Mark distribution (prefer evenly spread sub-parts)

**Part C (Choose 2 from 5)**
- Quickly rank all 5 by confidence (1-5)
- Select your top 2
- If tied, prefer:
  1. Topics with clearer requirements
  2. Topics with more "explain" than "calculate"
  3. Topics you've practiced recently

### Mid-Exam Adjustment Protocol

**After Part A (90 minutes in):**

```
IF on schedule:
    → Take 30-second mental break
    → Breathe deeply
    → Proceed to Part B as planned

IF 5-10 minutes behind:
    → Don't panic
    → Shorten Part B slightly (32 min instead of 35)
    → Proceed normally

IF 15+ minutes behind:
    → Part B in 30 minutes (key points only)
    → Part C questions in 22 minutes each
    → Use bullet points where necessary
```

**After Part B (125 minutes in):**

```
IF on schedule:
    → Quick stretch (if possible)
    → Review Part C question choices
    → Proceed confidently

IF 10+ minutes behind:
    → Part C questions in 20 minutes each
    → Focus on core requirements
    → Bullet points for conclusions
```

---

### The Final 10 Minutes Protocol

The last 10 minutes can rescue marks. Use them systematically.

**Final Review Checklist:**

**Structure Check (2 minutes):**
- [ ] All 5 questions attempted?
- [ ] Clear question numbers and headings?
- [ ] Logical paragraph structure?

**Calculation Check (3 minutes):**
- [ ] All calculations have workings shown?

## Answer Presentation Excellence

### Professional Formatting Standards

The exam instructions state: *"Marks may be allocated for clarity of presentation."*

**Formatting Best Practices:**

1. **Clear Question Identification**
   ```
   QUESTION 1

   1(a) UK Residence Status Under SRT

   [Your answer]

   1(b) DTA Tie-Breaker Application

   [Your answer]
   ```

2. **Logical Subheadings**
   - Use subheadings to structure long answers
   - Match subheadings to question requirements
   - Make it easy for examiner to find marking points

3. **Calculation Presentation**
   ```
   Taxable Employment Income - Daniel Door - 2024/25
                                                    £
   Salary                                      XX,XXX
   Benefits in kind                             X,XXX
                                              -------
   Total employment income                     XX,XXX
                                              =======
   ```

4. **Conclusion Format**
   - Always state a clear conclusion
   - "Therefore, Daniel IS/IS NOT UK resident for 2024/25 because..."
   - "In conclusion, the CFC charge amounts to £X..."

---

# SECTION 4.3: STRESS MANAGEMENT

## Understanding Exam Stress

Exam stress is normal and manageable. The key is having protocols ready before you need them.

### Physical Stress Symptoms and Responses

| Symptom | Quick Response |
|---------|----------------|
| Racing heart | Box breathing (4-4-4-4) |
| Sweaty palms | Wipe hands, brief pause |
| Shallow breathing | Deep belly breaths |
| Muscle tension | Progressive relaxation |
| Mind going blank | Stop, breathe, read question again |

### Box Breathing Technique

Use this before the exam and during any stressful moments:

```
      INHALE (4 seconds)
            │
            ▼
┌───────────────────────┐
│                       │
│  HOLD    →    HOLD    │  (4 seconds each)
│  (4 sec)     (4 sec)  │
│                       │
└───────────────────────┘
            │
            ▼
      EXHALE (4 seconds)
```

Repeat 3-4 times. Takes 48-64 seconds. Calms nervous system.

---

## Emergency Protocols

### Protocol 1: "I Don't Know This Topic"

**Situation**: You encounter a question on a topic you didn't prepare well.

**Response (5-step recovery):**

1. **Don't panic** (30 seconds)
   - Breathe deeply
   - This happens to everyone
   - You can still earn marks

2. **Read carefully** (1 minute)
   - Identify what IS asked (not what you don't know)
   - Look for familiar elements
   - Note the mark allocation

3. **Apply general principles** (main time)
   - Use IRAC structure (always earns marks)
   - Apply related knowledge
   - Show logical reasoning
   - State relevant legislation (even if uncertain)

4. **Show your thinking** (throughout)
   - Examiners reward methodology
   - "The relevant consideration would be..."
   - "Applying general principles..."

5. **Move on if stuck** (after 5-7 minutes on any sub-part)
   - Write what you know
   - Move to next question
   - Return if time permits

### Protocol 2: "I'm Running Out of Time"

**Situation**: You're significantly behind schedule with questions remaining.

**Response (triage approach):**

**If 10+ minutes behind with 1+ questions remaining:**

1. **Assess immediately**
   - How many marks are left to attempt?
   - Which questions/parts are unattempted?

2. **Switch to bullet mode**
   - Abandon prose paragraphs
   - Write key points as bullets
   - Include legislation references
   - State conclusions clearly

3. **Prioritise high-value items**
   - Calculations (if quick)
   - Main principles
   - Direct answers to requirements

4. **Never leave blanks**
   - Attempt every question
   - A partial answer beats nothing
   - Structure alone earns marks

**Bullet Mode Example:**

Instead of: "The Statutory Residence Test in Schedule 45 of the Finance Act 2013 provides that an individual will be automatically UK resident if they are present in the UK for 183 days or more in the tax year. In this case, Daniel was present for 98 days..."

Write:
```
SRT Analysis - Daniel 2024/25
• 183-day automatic test: NOT MET (98 days < 183)
• Only home test: NOT MET (homes in multiple countries)
• Full-time work test: NOT MET (not FT in UK)
→ Sufficient Ties Test applies
```

### Protocol 3: "My Mind Went Blank"

**Situation**: Mid-question, you suddenly can't remember anything.

**Response (reset protocol):**

1. **Stop writing** (immediately)
   - Don't stare at blank paper
   - Don't panic

2. **Physical reset** (30 seconds)
   - Close eyes briefly
   - 3 deep breaths
   - Stretch hands/shoulders

3. **Re-read the question** (30 seconds)
   - Fresh perspective
   - Often triggers recall

4. **Start with structure** (if still stuck)
   - Write headings from your template
   - The framework will help recall content
   - "Issue:", "Rule:", "Application:", "Conclusion:"

5. **Write something** (anything relevant)
   - Movement creates momentum
   - One point leads to another
   - Trust your preparation

### Protocol 4: "I Made a Major Mistake"

**Situation**: You realise you've misread a question or made a significant error.

**Response (damage control):**

1. **Don't go back** (usually)
   - Time spent rewriting is time lost elsewhere
   - Unless error is in first 5 minutes of answer

2. **Quick correction** (if possible)
   - "Note: Upon re-reading, the above should be adjusted for..."
   - Brief corrective statement
   - Move on

3. **Mental reset**
   - Everyone makes mistakes
   - Other questions can compensate
   - Focus forward

---

## Maintaining Focus Over 3 Hours

### The 90-Minute Mental Milestone

The human brain naturally flags around 90 minutes. Plan for this.

**At the 90-minute mark (after Part A):**

- [ ] Brief mental break (30 seconds)
- [ ] Stretch if possible
- [ ] Sip water
- [ ] Reset focus for Part B
- [ ] Positive self-talk: "Half done. Strong finish."

### Focus Maintenance Techniques

**Technique 1: Micro-Breaks**
- Between questions: 30-second pause
- Deep breath, reset focus
- Don't rush transitions

**Technique 2: Physical Awareness**
- Notice tension (shoulders, jaw)
- Quick release
- Maintain good posture

**Technique 3: Progress Acknowledgment**
- After each question: "That's done. Moving on."
- Don't ruminate on completed answers
- Forward focus only

**Technique 4: Water and Breathing**
- Regular sips of water
- Prevents dry mouth and maintains alertness
- Deep breaths between sections

---

# SECTION 4.4: MOCK EXAM PROTOCOL

## Score Prediction Model

Based on mock exam performance, estimate your likely real exam score:

**Factors that affect real exam vs mock:**
- Stress (usually -5 to -10 marks)
- Unfamiliar topics (variable)
- Better time pressure performance (some candidates +5 marks)
- Adrenaline focus (can help or hurt)

**Conservative Prediction Formula:**
```
Predicted Score = (Average Mock Score × 0.9) - 5

Example:
- Mock average: 65/100
- Prediction: (65 × 0.9) - 5 = 53.5/100

If your prediction is:
- Above 55: Good position for passing
- 50-55: Borderline, focus on weak areas
- Below 50: Need more preparation
```

**Pass Score**: Generally 50% (50/100), but aim for 55-60+ for safety.
