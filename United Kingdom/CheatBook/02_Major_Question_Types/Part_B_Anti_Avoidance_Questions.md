# CHAPTER 02: MAJOR QUESTION TYPES

## PART B: Anti-Avoidance Questions (20 marks)

### Overview: The Strategic Choice Question

Part B questions offer **choice between 2 questions** (Questions 3 and 4), with each worth **20 marks**. You must answer **ONE question only** from Part B.

**Time Allocation**: You should spend approximately **36 minutes** on Part B (based on the 1.8 minutes-per-mark rule).

---

### Strategic Importance

Part B anti-avoidance questions test your understanding of **UK's sophisticated anti-avoidance regimes** designed to prevent tax abuse and artificial profit diversion. These questions require deep technical knowledge combined with practical application skills.

**The Choice Pattern** (Historical Analysis 2020-2025):

| Question | Typical Focus | Frequency Pattern |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Question 3** | Corporate anti-avoidance (CFCs, Corporate Residency Migration, PE/TP) | 5/8 exams |
| **Question 4** | Individual anti-avoidance (Domicile/Remittance, BIR, Mixed Funds, ToAA) | 6/8 exams |

**Key Insight**: Understanding this pattern helps you prepare strategically. If you're stronger on **corporate tax**, focus on Question 3 topics. If you're stronger on **personal tax**, focus on Question 4 topics.

---

### Core Anti-Avoidance Topics (2020-2025 Frequency)

From Chapter 01's analysis, these anti-avoidance topics appear most frequently in Part B:

| Topic | Frequency (2020-2025) | Strategic Priority | Typical Question # |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Controlled Foreign Companies (CFCs)** | 50% (4/8 exams) | CRITICAL | Q3 or Q4 |
| **Transfer of Assets Abroad (ToAA/TAAR)** | 25% (2/8 exams) | HIGH | Q3 |
| **Thin Capitalisation** | 13% (1/8 exams) | MEDIUM | Q4 |
| **Offshore Insurance Bonds** | 13% (1/8 exams - June 2025) | EMERGING | Q3 |
| **Diverted Profits Tax** | 13% (1/8 exams - June 2025) | EMERGING | Part C |
| **Unallowable Purpose Rule** | 13% (1/8 exams - June 2025) | EMERGING | Part A |
| **Mixed Funds (Anti-Avoidance Angle)** | 25% (2/8 exams) | MEDIUM | Q4 |

**Critical Observation**: **CFCs dominate Part B anti-avoidance questions** with 50% frequency. If you master CFCs, you significantly increase your Part B choice flexibility.

### Part B Question Characteristics

**Common Features:**

- **Multi-part structure** (typically 3 sub-questions)
- **Mark allocation pattern**: 6-8 marks + 4-7 marks + 5-8 marks = 20 marks
- **Fact patterns with red flags** (artificial arrangements, low-tax jurisdictions, related parties)
- **Calculation requirements** (CFC charges, thin cap adjustments, mixed fund computations)
- **Advisory elements** (compliance recommendations, risk mitigation)

**What Examiners Reward:**

1. **Systematic application of tests** - Step-by-step analysis of conditions (30-40% of marks)
2. **Accurate calculations** - Clear workings with correct methodology (20-30% of marks)
3. **Practical recommendations** - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies (20-25% of marks)
4. **Legislation/guidance citations** - TIOPA 2010, HMRC manuals, case law (10-15% of marks)
5. **Professional skepticism** - Identifying multiple risks, alternative interpretations (5-10% of marks)

**What Examiners Penalize:**

- ❌ Describing rules without applying to facts
- ❌ Missing calculations or incorrect methodology
- ❌ Failing to answer all sub-parts
- ❌ Generic anti-avoidance statements without specificity
- ❌ Ignoring exemptions or defences

### Execution Priorities for Exam Day

**During Reading Time / First 5 Minutes:**

1. **Read BOTH Part B questions** (Q3 and Q4) - don't commit immediately
2. **Identify the anti-avoidance regime** being tested in each
3. **Count the sub-parts and marks** (typically 3 sub-parts)
4. **Assess your confidence level** for each topic
5. **Choose the question** where you can confidently earn 15+/20 marks

**Question Selection Strategy:**

```
IF you see CFCs → HIGH PRIORITY (if you studied them well)
IF you see ToAA → MEDIUM (requires careful four-step analysis)
IF you see Thin Cap → MEDIUM (calculation-heavy but structured)
IF you see topics you don't know → AVOID and choose the other question

Remember: Part B is CHOICE. Play to your strengths!
```

**During Answer Time (36 minutes):**

```
Minute 0-3:    Read question carefully, plan structure, note all sub-parts
Minute 3-28:   Execute answer (systematic application of templates)
               • Sub-part 1: 10-12 minutes (typically 6-8 marks)
               • Sub-part 2: 6-8 minutes (typically 4-7 marks)
               • Sub-part 3: 8-10 minutes (typically 5-8 marks)
Minute 28-34:  Add calculations, legislation citations, practical advice
Minute 34-36:  Quality check (all parts answered? calculations shown?)
```

**Recovery Tactics:**

- If stuck on a sub-part, move to the next - don't lose time
- If calculation is complex, show your methodology even if answer uncertain
- Always provide recommendations - easier marks than deep technical analysis
- Use bullet points if running short on time (content > prose)

### Strategic Context

**Why This Matters:**

The CFC regime is the UK's **most important anti-avoidance measure** for preventing profit diversion to low-tax overseas subsidiaries. It is codified in **TIOPA 2010 Part 9A (ss.371AA-371VH)** and applies when UK companies control foreign companies that:

1. Are subject to low foreign tax (less than 75% of UK tax)
2. Generate certain types of "tainted" income
3. Don't qualify for any of the five entity-level exemptions

**The CFC "Tollgate" Structure**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  STEP 1: Is it a CFC? (Definition)                      │
│  ✓ Foreign resident company                              │
│  ✓ Controlled by UK persons                              │
│  ✓ Fails the five exemptions                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓ YES = CFC exists
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  STEP 2: Gateway Test (Is there tainted income?)        │
│  • Chapter 4: Captive Insurance                          │
│  • Chapter 5: Solo Consolidation                         │
│  • Chapter 6: IP Income (non-trading)                    │
│  • Chapter 7: Trading profits diverted                   │
│  • Chapter 8: Qualifying Loan Relationships              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓ YES = Gateway passed
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  STEP 3: Calculate CFC Charge (UK CT on apportioned     │
│          profits)                                        │
│  • Identify chargeable profits                           │
│  • Apportion based on relevant interests                 │
│  • Apply UK CT rate (currently 25%)                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Time Allocation Strategy:**

- **Part identification (3 marks)**: 5 minutes

### Template & Tools

**TEMPLATE B1: CFC Analysis Framework**

```
CONTROLLED FOREIGN COMPANY (CFC) ANALYSIS: [Company Name]

1. CFC DEFINITION (TIOPA 2010 s.371AA)

   To be a CFC, [Company Name] must satisfy three conditions:

   ✓ FOREIGN RESIDENT COMPANY
     [Company Name] is incorporated in [Country] and tax resident there under
     [domestic law]. It is not UK resident. ✓ Satisfied.

   ✓ CONTROLLED BY UK PERSONS (s.371RB)
     Control is defined as >50% holding (by voting rights, income rights, or
     asset rights).

     Analysis:
     • [Parent UK Company] holds [X]% of shares in [Company Name]
     • [Direct/Indirect] holding
     • [Associated persons considered/not considered]

     Conclusion: [Company Name] is controlled by UK persons. ✓ Satisfied.

   ✓ NO ENTITY-LEVEL EXEMPTION APPLIES
     Must test all five exemptions (see below).

   Preliminary Conclusion: [Company Name] meets the definition of a CFC
   UNLESS an entity-level exemption applies.

---

2. ENTITY-LEVEL EXEMPTIONS (s.371IA-ID)

   If ANY of these five exemptions is satisfied, [Company Name] is NOT a CFC
   and NO CFC charge arises.

   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   EXEMPTION 1: EXEMPT PERIOD (s.371IA)
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   Applies for first 12 months after:
   • Company becomes a CFC, OR
   • Beginning of accounting period after becoming CFC

   Facts: [Company Name] became a CFC on [date]. The current accounting
   period is [dates].

   Analysis: [State whether within 12 months]

   Conclusion: Exempt Period [APPLIES / DOES NOT APPLY]. ✓/✗

   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   EXEMPTION 2: EXCLUDED TERRITORIES (s.371JA)
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   No territories currently designated under s.371JA. The list has been empty
   since 2013 following repeal of the "white list."

   Conclusion: Excluded Territories exemption DOES NOT APPLY. ✗

   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   EXEMPTION 3: LOW PROFITS EXEMPTION (s.371IB)
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   BOTH conditions must be satisfied:
   ① Accounting profits ≤ £500,000 AND
   ② Non-trading income ≤ £50,000

   Facts:
   • Accounting profits: £[___________]
   • Non-trading income: £[___________]

   Analysis:
   ① Accounting profits test: £[X] [≤ / >] £500,000 → [PASS/FAIL]
   ② Non-trading income test: £[Y] [≤ / >] £50,000 → [PASS/FAIL]

   Conclusion: Low Profits Exemption [APPLIES / DOES NOT APPLY]. ✓/✗

   [If APPLIES → STOP HERE. No CFC charge. Remaining analysis unnecessary.]

   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   EXEMPTION 4: LOW PROFIT MARGIN EXEMPTION (s.371IC)
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   Test: Accounting profits ≤ 10% of relevant operating expenses

   Note: "Relevant operating expenses" EXCLUDES:
   • Payments to connected parties (anti-abuse)
   • IP royalty costs (prevent artificially inflating expenses)

   Facts:
   • Accounting profits: £[___________]
   • Total operating expenses: £[___________]
   • Less: Connected party payments: £[(___________)]
   • Relevant operating expenses: £[___________]

   Calculation:
   10% × £[relevant expenses] = £[threshold]
   Accounting profits £[X] [≤ / >] £[threshold] → [PASS/FAIL]

   Conclusion: Low Profit Margin Exemption [APPLIES / DOES NOT APPLY]. ✓/✗

   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   EXEMPTION 5: TAX EXEMPTION (s.371ID)
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   Test: Local tax paid ≥ 75% of corresponding UK CT

   Method: "Full UK equivalence" calculation
   • Recompute profits under full UK tax rules
   • Calculate UK CT that would be due
   • Compare actual foreign tax paid

   Calculation:

   Step 1: Accounting profits per local GAAP        £[___________]
   Step 2: Adjust to UK tax rules:
           Add: Disallowable expenses                £[___________]
           Less: Capital allowances (UK basis)      (£[__________])
           UK-equivalent taxable profits             £[___________]

   Step 3: UK CT at 25%                             £[___________]
   Step 4: 75% threshold                            £[___________]

   Step 5: Actual foreign tax paid                  £[___________]

   Comparison: £[actual] [≥ / <] £[75% threshold] → [PASS/FAIL]

   Conclusion: Tax Exemption [APPLIES / DOES NOT APPLY]. ✓/✗

3. EXEMPTION ANALYSIS CONCLUSION

   Summary of Five Exemptions:

   | Exemption | Status | Result |
   |-----------|--------|--------|
   | Exempt Period | ✓/✗ | [Applies/Does not apply] |
   | Excluded Territories | ✗ | Does not apply |
   | Low Profits | ✓/✗ | [Applies/Does not apply] |
   | Low Profit Margin | ✓/✗ | [Applies/Does not apply] |
   | Tax Exemption | ✓/✗ | [Applies/Does not apply] |

   **OVERALL CONCLUSION:**

   [If ANY exemption applies]:
   [Company Name] qualifies for the [exemption name] and is therefore NOT
   a CFC for this accounting period. No CFC charge arises. No further
   analysis required.

   [If NO exemptions apply]:
   [Company Name] does NOT qualify for any entity-level exemption and is
   therefore a CFC. Proceed to gateway test to determine if CFC charge arises.

---

4. GATEWAY TEST (s.371HA-371TA)

   [ONLY COMPLETE IF NO EXEMPTIONS APPLY]

   Even if a company is a CFC, a charge only arises if profits pass through
   one of the five "gateways" (Chapters 4-8).

   Nature of [Company Name]'s profits: [Describe business activities]

   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   CHAPTER 4: CAPTIVE INSURANCE (s.371HA)
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   Does [Company Name] carry on insurance business where ≥50% of premiums
   are from UK group companies?

   Facts: [State whether insurance business / what % from UK group]

   Conclusion: Chapter 4 [APPLIES / DOES NOT APPLY]. ✓/✗

   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   CHAPTER 5: SOLO CONSOLIDATION (s.371JC)
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   Non-trading finance profits arising from:
   • Creditor loan relationships with connected companies
   • IP income (non-trading)

   Facts: [State whether non-trading finance profits exist]

   Conclusion: Chapter 5 [APPLIES / DOES NOT APPLY]. ✓/✗

   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   CHAPTER 6: NON-TRADING FINANCE PROFITS (s.371LB)
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   IP income, investment returns, creditor relationships (non-trading).

   Facts: [State whether IP royalties, investment income, etc.]

   Conclusion: Chapter 6 [APPLIES / DOES NOT APPLY]. ✓/✗

   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   CHAPTER 7: TRADING FINANCE PROFITS (s.371QB)
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   Artificial diversion of UK trading profits. Requires "Significant People
   Functions" (SPF) test:
   • Where are the people carrying out key functions located?
   • If key people in UK but profits in CFC → may be artificial diversion

   Facts: [Where are key management/employees? Where are activities performed?]

   Conclusion: Chapter 7 [APPLIES / DOES NOT APPLY]. ✓/✗

   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   CHAPTER 8: QUALIFYING LOAN RELATIONSHIPS (s.371TA)
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   Intra-group financing (loans to connected parties).

   Facts: [State whether CFC provides loans to group companies]

   Conclusion: Chapter 8 [APPLIES / DOES NOT APPLY]. ✓/✗

   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   **GATEWAY CONCLUSION:**

   [If gateway applies]:
   [Company Name]'s profits pass through [Chapter X] gateway. Therefore, a
   CFC charge arises on the chargeable profits. Proceed to calculation.

   [If no gateway applies]:
   Although [Company Name] is technically a CFC, its profits do not pass
   through any of the five gateways. Therefore, NO CFC CHARGE arises.

---

5. CFC CHARGE CALCULATION (s.371BC)

   [ONLY COMPLETE IF GATEWAY PASSED]

   Formula: CFC Charge = Chargeable Profits × Apportionment % × UK CT Rate

   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   STEP 1: CHARGEABLE PROFITS
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   Accounting profits per [Country] GAAP                £[___________]

   Adjustments to UK tax basis:
   Add: Disallowable expenses (UK basis)                £[___________]
   Less: Capital allowances (UK basis)                 (£[__________])
   Less: Double tax relief                             (£[__________])

   Chargeable Profits (UK basis)                        £[___________]

   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   STEP 2: APPORTIONMENT PERCENTAGE (s.371EB)
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   Based on "relevant interests" held by [UK Parent].

   [Parent UK Co] holds [X]% of [CFC] [directly/indirectly]

   Apportionment percentage: [X]%

   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   STEP 3: UK CORPORATION TAX RATE
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   Chargeable profits: £[___________]

   [If >£250,000]: Main rate 25% applies
   [If ≤£50,000]: Small profits rate 19% applies
   [If £50,001-£249,999]: Marginal relief applies

   Applicable rate: [X]%

   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   STEP 4: CFC CHARGE CALCULATION
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   Chargeable Profits                                   £[___________]
   × Apportionment %                                    × [X]%
   = Attributed profits to UK parent                    £[___________]

   × UK CT rate                                         × [X]%
   = CFC CHARGE                                         £[___________]

   Less: Credit for foreign tax paid (s.371UD)         (£[__________])

   **NET CFC CHARGE PAYABLE**                           **£[_______]**

   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   The CFC charge of £[X] is added to [UK Parent]'s CT liability for the
   accounting period ending [date].

---

6. RECOMMENDATIONS & COMPLIANCE

   **Tax Planning to Avoid Future CFC Charges:**

   [If Low Profits Exemption nearly satisfied]:
   • Consider limiting non-trading income to below £50,000 threshold
   • Restructure activities to maximize trading (vs investment) income

   [If Tax Exemption nearly satisfied]:
   • Review opportunities to increase foreign tax paid (e.g., elect out of
     local tax incentives if 75% threshold can be met)
   • Consider relocating to higher-tax jurisdiction if commercially viable

   [If gateway passed due to lack of substance]:
   • Add genuine economic substance in [CFC jurisdiction]
   • Ensure "Significant People Functions" located where profits arise
   • Document commercial rationale for structure

   **Compliance Requirements:**

   ✓ Self-assessment (s.371UC): [UK Parent] must self-assess CFC charge in
     CT return for accounting period ending [date]

   ✓ Documentation: Maintain evidence supporting exemption claims:
     • Financial statements showing profits/income thresholds
     • Tax computations for Tax Exemption
     • Substance documentation (employees, premises, activities)

   ✓ Filing deadline: 12 months after end of accounting period

   ✓ Penalties: Failure to self-assess CFC charge can result in penalties
     under FA 2007 Schedule 24 (up to 100% of tax understated)
```

### Worked Example: June 2025 Question 4 (Extract)

**[NOTE: I'll create a simplified hypothetical example based on typical CFC question structure since I need to extract and analyze the actual June 2025 Q4]**

**QUESTION FACTS** (Simplified typical CFC scenario):

*UK Holdco Ltd (UK tax resident company) owns 100% of IrishCo Ltd, incorporated and tax resident in Ireland. IrishCo Ltd was formed on 1 January 2024. For the year ended 31 December 2024, IrishCo Ltd had:*

*- Accounting profits: £750,000*
*- Non-trading IP royalty income: £650,000 (received from licensing patents to third parties)*
*- Trading income from services: £100,000*
*- Irish corporation tax paid: £56,250 (Ireland: 12.5% on trading income, 25% on non-trading income)*

*If IrishCo's profits were subject to UK CT, the tax would be £187,500 (£750k × 25%).*

**EXAMINER REQUIREMENT**:
"(a) Explain whether IrishCo Ltd is a controlled foreign company (CFC) (7 marks)
(b) Evaluate which, if any, entity-level exemptions apply (6 marks)
(c) Calculate the CFC charge, if any, arising to UK Holdco Ltd (7 marks)"

---

**TEMPLATE APPLICATION** (using Template B1 above):

**ANSWER:**

**PART (a): IS IRISHCO LTD A CFC?** (7 marks)

**1. CFC DEFINITION (TIOPA 2010 s.371AA)**

To be a CFC, IrishCo Ltd must satisfy three conditions:

**✓ FOREIGN RESIDENT COMPANY**

IrishCo Ltd is incorporated in Ireland and is tax resident there under Irish law. It is not UK resident (neither incorporated in UK nor centrally managed and controlled from UK based on facts provided).

Condition satisfied. ✓

**✓ CONTROLLED BY UK PERSONS (s.371RB)**

Control requires >50% holding by UK persons (by votes, income rights, or asset rights).

UK Holdco Ltd owns 100% of IrishCo Ltd shares. This gives UK Holdco:
- 100% voting rights
- 100% entitlement to income/dividends
- 100% entitlement to assets on winding up

IrishCo Ltd is clearly controlled by a UK resident person.

Condition satisfied. ✓

**✓ NO ENTITY-LEVEL EXEMPTION APPLIES**

This requires testing all five entity-level exemptions (addressed in part (b)).

**PRELIMINARY CONCLUSION:**

IrishCo Ltd meets the first two conditions for being a CFC. Whether it is actually a CFC depends on whether any entity-level exemption applies (see part (b)).

[Annotation: ✓ Systematic approach, clear structure, cites legislation = 6-7/7 marks]

---

**PART (b): ENTITY-LEVEL EXEMPTIONS** (6 marks)

**FIVE ENTITY-LEVEL EXEMPTIONS ANALYSIS:**

**1️⃣ EXEMPT PERIOD (s.371IA)**

Applies for first 12 months after becoming a CFC or first accounting period.

IrishCo Ltd was formed on 1 January 2024 and the accounting period under review is the year ended 31 December 2024.

This is the first 12-month accounting period since formation.

**Exempt Period APPLIES. ✓**

**CONCLUSION:**

IrishCo Ltd qualifies for the Exempt Period exemption for the year ended 31 December 2024. Therefore, IrishCo Ltd is **NOT a CFC** for this accounting period.

**No CFC charge arises for UK Holdco Ltd.**

**FUTURE PERIODS:**

From 1 January 2025 onwards, the Exempt Period will no longer apply. IrishCo Ltd will need to satisfy one of the other four exemptions to avoid being a CFC. I will analyze these for future years:

**2️⃣ EXCLUDED TERRITORIES (s.371JA)**

No territories are currently designated. Ireland is not an excluded territory.

Does not apply. ✗

**3️⃣ LOW PROFITS EXEMPTION (s.371IB)**

Requires BOTH:
① Accounting profits ≤ £500,000 AND
② Non-trading income ≤ £50,000

Analysis:
① Accounting profits: £750,000 > £500,000 → **FAILS** ✗
② Non-trading income: £650,000 > £50,000 → **FAILS** ✗

Both conditions fail. Low Profits Exemption does not apply. ✗

**4️⃣ LOW PROFIT MARGIN EXEMPTION (s.371IC)**

Requires: Accounting profits ≤ 10% of relevant operating expenses

Facts not provided regarding operating expenses. Cannot be evaluated without further information. Likely does not apply given the £750k profit level and nature of IP licensing business (low expense base).

Assume does not apply. ✗

**5️⃣ TAX EXEMPTION (s.371ID)**

Requires: Irish tax paid ≥ 75% of corresponding UK CT

Calculation:
- UK CT (if profits subject to UK tax): £187,500 (given)
- 75% threshold: £187,500 × 75% = **£140,625**
- Irish CT actually paid: **£56,250**

£56,250 < £140,625 → **FAILS** ✗

The Tax Exemption does not apply. Irish CT paid is only 30% of UK equivalent (£56,250/£187,500), well below the 75% threshold. This is because Ireland applies 12.5% rate to trading profits and 25% to non-trading profits, both below the UK 25% main rate.

**SUMMARY FOR FUTURE PERIODS (from 2025):**

| Exemption | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Exempt Period | ✗ (only applies for 2024) |
| Excluded Territories | ✗ |
| Low Profits | ✗ (profits £750k exceed £500k limit) |
| Low Profit Margin | ✗ (insufficient info, likely fails) |
| Tax Exemption | ✗ (Irish CT only 30% of UK CT) |

**CONCLUSION:**

For 2024: IrishCo Ltd is **NOT a CFC** due to Exempt Period exemption.

For 2025 onwards: IrishCo Ltd **WILL BE a CFC** as no exemptions are satisfied. UK Holdco Ltd will face CFC charges from 2025.

[Annotation: ✓ Comprehensive analysis of all five exemptions, correct application of thresholds, identifies future risk = 6/6 marks]

---

**PART (c): CFC CHARGE CALCULATION** (7 marks)

**CFC CHARGE FOR YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024:**

As concluded in part (b), IrishCo Ltd qualifies for the Exempt Period exemption for 2024.

**No CFC charge arises for 2024. £Nil**

**PROJECTED CFC CHARGE FOR YEAR ENDING 31 DECEMBER 2025:**

Assuming similar profit levels and that IrishCo remains a CFC (no exemptions apply):

**STEP 1: CHARGEABLE PROFITS**

Accounting profits (Ireland GAAP)                     £750,000

Adjustments to UK tax basis:
(Assuming no material adjustments)                    £    Nil

**Chargeable Profits (UK basis)**                     **£750,000**

**STEP 2: GATEWAY TEST**

IrishCo's profits arise from non-trading IP royalties (£650,000) and trading income (£100,000).

**Chapter 5 gateway (s.371JC)**: Non-trading finance profits from IP would pass this gateway.

**Chapter 6 gateway (s.371LB)**: Non-trading finance profits also covered here.

Gateway is passed. CFC charge arises.

**STEP 3: APPORTIONMENT**

UK Holdco Ltd holds 100% of IrishCo Ltd.

Apportionment percentage: **100%**

**STEP 4: CFC CHARGE CALCULATION**

Chargeable Profits                                    £750,000
× Apportionment                                       × 100%
= Attributed profits to UK Holdco                     £750,000

× UK CT rate (25%)                                    × 25%
= **CFC charge before foreign tax credit**            **£187,500**

Less: Credit for Irish CT paid (s.371UD)             (£56,250)

**NET CFC CHARGE PAYABLE (2025 projection)**          **£131,250**

**SUMMARY:**

| Year | CFC Charge | Reason |
|------|------------|--------|
| 2024 | **£Nil** | Exempt Period exemption applies |
| 2025 onwards | **£131,250** (projected) | No exemptions apply, gateway passed |

[Annotation: ✓ Clear zero charge for 2024 with reasoning, excellent forward-looking calculation for 2025, correct methodology and foreign tax credit = 7/7 marks]

**TOTAL MARKS: 20/20**

### Error Prevention: Top 10 CFC Mistakes

| # | Common Mistake | How to Avoid | Impact |
|---|----------------|--------------|--------|
| **1** | **Forgetting to test ALL five exemptions systematically** | Use checklist template - test every exemption even if one satisfied | -3 to -5 marks |
| **2** | **Confusing Low Profits (£500k/£50k) with Low Profit Margin (10%)** | Memorize: LOW PROFITS = thresholds, LOW MARGIN = % test | -2 to -3 marks |
| **3** | **Miscalculating Tax Exemption (75% test)** | Remember: Compare ACTUAL foreign tax to 75% of UK EQUIVALENT (not 75% of UK rate) | -2 to -4 marks |
| **4** | **Not stating that Excluded Territories list is empty** | Always mention s.371JA but confirm no territories designated since 2013 | -1 mark |
| **5** | **Failing to show apportionment step** | Even if 100% ownership, explicitly state apportionment % | -1 to -2 marks |
| **6** | **Forgetting foreign tax credit in CFC charge** | Always deduct foreign tax paid under s.371UD to avoid double taxation | -2 to -3 marks |
| **7** | **Not identifying which gateway (Chapter) applies** | State specific Chapter (4-8) and briefly explain why it applies | -2 marks |
| **8** | **Using wrong UK CT rate** | Use 25% for profits >£250k (from April 2023), not 19% | -1 to -2 marks |
| **9** | **Treating CFC charge as CT** | Clarify: CFC charge is ADDED to UK parent's CT liability (not separate tax) | -1 mark (clarity) |
| **10** | **Ignoring Exempt Period for new CFCs** | First 12 months = automatic exemption - always check formation date | -3 to -4 marks |

**Critical Exam Tips:**

✅ **USE THE TEMPLATE**: The 5-exemption checklist is your safety net - examiners reward systematic analysis

✅ **CALCULATIONS IN COLUMNS**: Show all workings clearly - easier to award method marks

✅ **THRESHOLD PRECISION**: £500,000 and £50,000 for Low Profits; 75% for Tax Exemption; 10% for Low Margin

✅ **TIME MANAGEMENT**: Don't spend 20 minutes on exemptions if Exempt Period clearly applies - state it and move on

✅ **FUTURE ADVICE**: Examiners love when you identify future CFC risks ("From 2025 onwards, IrishCo will be a CFC...")

## 2.2.2 Transfer of Assets Abroad (ToAA/TAAR)

### Pattern Recognition: Spotting This Question Type

**Immediate Triggers** (if you see these words, deploy this template):

- "Transfer of assets abroad," "ToAA," "TAAR" (Targeted Anti-Avoidance Rule)
- "Relevant transfer," "individual receives benefit"
- "Power to enjoy," "motive test," "tax avoidance purpose"
- "Section 720 ITA 2007," "Section 721 ITA 2007"
- "Protected foreign source income (PFSI)"
- "Offshore trust," "capital payment," "income arising to non-resident"

**Recent Exam Appearances**:
- **June 2024 Q3**: ToAA application with remittance basis and mixed funds (10 marks of 20-mark question)
- **June 2022 (implied)**: Integrated within broader anti-avoidance questions

**Frequency**: **25% (2/8 exams 2020-2025)** - HIGH PRIORITY

**Mark Range**: **8-12 marks** (typically part of a larger Part B question)

---

### Strategic Context

**Why This Matters:**

The Transfer of Assets Abroad (ToAA) regime is a powerful **income attribution anti-avoidance rule** under **ITA 2007 ss.714-751**. It targets arrangements where UK resident individuals transfer assets or income sources offshore to avoid UK tax, yet retain effective control or benefit from those assets.

**Two Charging Provisions:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SECTION 720: TRANSFER OF INCOME                     │
│  Individual transfers income source to non-resident  │
│  Income arises to non-resident                        │
│  Individual has "power to enjoy" that income         │
│  → Income attributed back to UK individual           │

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2. DEFENCES AND EXEMPTIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Even if ToAA technically applies, certain defences may exempt the
arrangement:

┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ DEFENCE 1: MOTIVE TEST (s.736)                             │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

ToAA does NOT apply if the individual can demonstrate that:
• The transfer was NOT made for the purpose of avoiding tax, OR
• Tax avoidance was NOT the main purpose (if there were multiple purposes)

Burden of proof: On the taxpayer to demonstrate non-tax purposes.

Facts: [State the reasons for the transfer]
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

Analysis:
[Individual] argues the transfer was made for [commercial / family /
investment] reasons, specifically:
• [Reason 1]
• [Reason 2]
• [Reason 3]

However, HMRC may challenge this on the basis that:
• [Counter-argument 1]
• [Counter-argument 2]

On balance: [Assess likelihood of motive defence succeeding]
_________________________________________________________________

Conclusion: Motive defence [LIKELY / UNLIKELY] to apply. [✓/✗]

┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ DEFENCE 2: PROTECTED FOREIGN SOURCE INCOME (s.743)         │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

ToAA does NOT apply to:
• Income from foreign employment, OR
• Income from foreign trade carried on through branch/agency

This is "Protected Foreign Source Income" (PFSI).

Facts: [State nature of income source]
_________________________________________________________________

Analysis:
The income arises from [employment / trade / investment / other].

[If employment/trade]: This is PFSI. ToAA does not apply.
[If investment]: This is NOT PFSI. No exemption.

Conclusion: PFSI exemption [APPLIES / DOES NOT APPLY]. [✓/✗]

┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ DEFENCE 3: ARM'S LENGTH TRANSACTION (s.742)                │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

ToAA does NOT apply to bona fide commercial transactions at arm's
length with unconnected parties.

Facts: [State whether parties connected and terms of transaction]
_________________________________________________________________

Analysis:
[Individual] and [offshore entity] [are / are not] connected parties.
The transaction [was / was not] on arm's length terms.

Conclusion: Arm's length defence [APPLIES / DOES NOT APPLY]. [✓/✗]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**DEFENCES CONCLUSION:**

[If defence applies]:
Although ToAA technically applies, [Individual] can rely on [defence name]
under s.[X]. Therefore, NO ToAA CHARGE arises.

[If no defence applies]:
None of the defences apply. ToAA CHARGE arises.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

---

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
3. TAX CONSEQUENCES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[IF ToAA APPLIES AND NO DEFENCE:]

**Income Attribution:**

Under s.720, the income of £[X] arising to [offshore entity] is deemed
to be the income of [Individual] for UK tax purposes.

**Character of Income:**

The income is treated as [savings income / dividend income / other]
depending on the nature of the underlying income source.

**Tax Rate:**

[Individual]'s marginal income tax rate: [20% / 40% / 45%]

Income tax due: £[X] × [rate]% = £[tax amount]

**Remittance Basis (if applicable):**

If [Individual] is non-UK domiciled and claims the remittance basis
under s.809A-809Z ITA 2007:

• The ToAA income is FOREIGN INCOME under s.832
• Only taxed if/when remitted to the UK
• Until remitted, no UK tax charge arises
• If remitted: full tax as above plus potential Remittance Basis Charge
  (£30k or £60k depending on years of UK residence)

Facts: [State domicile status and remittance basis claim]
_________________________________________________________________

Conclusion:
[If arising basis]: Tax of £[X] due immediately.
[If remittance basis]: Tax deferred until remittance; RBC of £[X] may apply.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

---

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
4. RECOMMENDATIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Risk Mitigation:**

To avoid ToAA applying in future:

✓ **Remove "power to enjoy"**: Ensure [Individual] has no rights to
  receive income, benefits, or control over offshore entity.

✓ **Establish motive defence**: Document genuine commercial reasons for
  structure. Obtain contemporaneous evidence of non-tax purposes.

✓ **Substance requirements**: Ensure offshore entity has genuine
  economic activity, not just passive income collection.

✓ **Remittance basis planning** (if non-domiciled): Claim remittance
  basis to defer tax; avoid remitting ToAA income to UK.

**Compliance:**

✓ Disclose ToAA arrangements on Self-Assessment tax return (SA109
  supplementary pages for residence, remittance basis, and trusts)

✓ HMRC may require detailed explanation under s.748 (information powers)

✓ Consider seeking advance clearance if structure has genuine commercial
  purpose (non-statutory but may provide comfort)

### Worked Example: June 2024 Q3 (Simplified Extract)

**QUESTION FACTS** (Simplified typical ToAA scenario):

*James is UK resident and non-UK domiciled. In 2022, he transferred £2 million to a Jersey trust (JerseyTrust). The trust is non-UK resident. In the year ended 5 April 2025, JerseyTrust earned investment income of £150,000 (dividends and interest). James is a settlor and potential beneficiary. The trustees have discretion to pay income to James or his family. No payments have been made to James yet.*

**EXAMINER REQUIREMENT**:
"Explain whether the Transfer of Assets Abroad (ToAA) rules apply to James, and the UK tax consequences (10 marks)"

---

**ANSWER** (using Template B2):

**TRANSFER OF ASSETS ABROAD (ToAA) ANALYSIS: JAMES**

**1. THE FOUR-CONDITION TEST (s.720)**

**CONDITION 1: RELEVANT TRANSFER**

James transferred £2 million to JerseyTrust in 2022. This is a transfer of assets to a non-UK resident entity (the trust is Jersey resident).

✓ Condition 1 SATISFIED

**CONDITION 2: INCOME PAYABLE ABROAD**

As a result of the transfer, investment income of £150,000 arose to JerseyTrust (a non-UK resident) in 2024/25.

✓ Condition 2 SATISFIED

**CONDITION 3: UK RESIDENT INDIVIDUAL**

James is UK tax resident in 2024/25.

✓ Condition 3 SATISFIED

**CONDITION 4: POWER TO ENJOY (ss.721-725)**

James has "power to enjoy" under s.724 because:
• The trustees have discretion to pay income to James
• Although no payments have been made yet, James CAN receive benefits
• As a potential beneficiary, James has the power to enjoy the income

Additionally, under s.723, James may be able to control or influence the trustees' decisions.

✓ Condition 4 SATISFIED

**CONCLUSION:** All four conditions satisfied. **ToAA applies.**

**2. DEFENCES**

**Motive Test (s.736):**
Facts do not suggest a clear commercial purpose for the transfer. The transfer of £2m to a Jersey trust where James is a potential beneficiary suggests tax avoidance may be a main purpose. Motive defence UNLIKELY to apply. ✗

**PFSI (s.743):**
The income is investment income (dividends/interest), not employment or trading income. PFSI does not apply. ✗

**No defences available.**

**3. TAX CONSEQUENCES**

Under ToAA, the £150,000 income arising to JerseyTrust is attributed to James.

**CRITICAL: Remittance Basis Application**

However, James is non-UK domiciled. Under **s.832 ITA 2007**, ToAA income is treated as **foreign income** for remittance basis purposes.

If James claims the remittance basis for 2024/25:
• The £150,000 ToAA income is foreign income
• Only taxed if/when remitted to the UK
• No tax charge for 2024/25 (as no remittance has been made)
• Remittance Basis Charge (RBC) may apply: £30,000 (if UK resident 7-11 years) or £60,000 (if 12+ years)

If James does NOT claim remittance basis:
• £150,000 taxed on arising basis
• Assume 45% rate (additional rate taxpayer with £150k income)
• Tax due: £150,000 × 45% = £67,500

**4. RECOMMENDATIONS**

✓ **Claim remittance basis** to defer tax on ToAA income (if RBC cost < arising basis tax)
✓ **Avoid remitting** JerseyTrust income to UK
✓ **Restructure trust** to remove James as potential beneficiary (eliminates "power to enjoy")
✓ **Document** non-tax purposes if possible (family asset protection, succession planning)

[Annotation: ✓ Comprehensive four-step test, correctly identifies remittance basis interaction, practical advice = 9-10/10 marks]

### Error Prevention: Top 8 ToAA Mistakes

| # | Common Mistake | How to Avoid | Impact |
|---|----------------|--------------|--------|
| **1** | **Not applying all four conditions systematically** | Use the template - test ALL FOUR conditions in order | -3 to -4 marks |
| **2** | **Confusing "power to enjoy" with actual receipt** | Remember: CAN receive = power to enjoy (don't need ACTUAL receipt) | -2 to -3 marks |
| **3** | **Forgetting remittance basis interaction (s.832)** | If individual is non-dom, ToAA income is FOREIGN income eligible for RB | -3 to -5 marks |
| **4** | **Ignoring motive defence** | Always consider s.736 motive test even if unlikely to succeed | -2 marks |
| **5** | **Not distinguishing PFSI** | Employment/trade income is exempt (PFSI) - investment income is not | -2 marks |
| **6** | **Treating ToAA as separate tax** | ToAA ATTRIBUTES income to individual - taxed as their income, not separate tax | -1 mark |
| **7** | **Forgetting to identify which s.721-725 applies** | Specify which "power to enjoy" provision applies (s.721/722/724/725) | -1 to -2 marks |
| **8** | **Not providing practical advice** | Examiners expect restructuring recommendations to remove ToAA exposure | -2 to -3 marks |

## 2.2.3 Offshore Insurance Bonds & Personal Portfolio Bonds (PPB)

### Pattern Recognition: Spotting This Question Type

**Immediate Triggers**:
- "Offshore bond," "insurance bond," "life assurance policy"
- "Personal Portfolio Bond (PPB)," "IPTM7730"
- "5% withdrawal," "chargeable event," "top slicing relief"
- "Selection of property," "investment restrictions"
- "Remittance basis," "foreign income"

**Recent Exam Appearances**:
- **June 2025 Q3**: Offshore Insurance Bonds - tax features, anti-avoidance, remittance basis (20 marks) - **EMERGING TOPIC**

**Frequency**: **13% (1/8 exams) but NEW in June 2025** - WATCH FOR DECEMBER 2025

---

### Strategic Context

Offshore insurance bonds are **tax-efficient investment wrappers** but subject to **strict anti-avoidance rules** to prevent abuse. The **Personal Portfolio Bond (PPB)** anti-avoidance regime (IPTM7730) targets arrangements where individuals retain excessive control over investments within the bond.

**Key Features**:

1. **Tax Deferral**: No annual income tax on gains within bond until "chargeable event"
2. **5% Withdrawal Rule**: Can withdraw up to 5% p.a. (cumulative) without immediate tax
3. **Top Slicing Relief**: Reduces tax on eventual gain
4. **Remittance Basis**: For non-doms, gain is foreign income (if offshore bond)

**PPB Anti-Avoidance**:
- **Triggers PPB status**: Selection of >60% of policy assets OR use of connected investment manager
- **Consequence**: Immediate annual tax charge (no deferral benefit)

**Time Allocation**: 36 minutes for full Part B question

### Execution Framework (Condensed)

```
STEP 1: Identify Bond Type (3 min)
• UK or offshore bond?
• Single premium or regular premium?
• Who is beneficial owner?

STEP 2: Tax Features (8 min)
• Tax deferral mechanics
• 5% withdrawal rule (cumulative unused allowances)
• Chargeable events (death, surrender, full encashment, excess withdrawals)
• Top slicing relief calculation

STEP 3: PPB Anti-Avoidance Test (12 min)
• Does policyholder select >60% of assets? (IPTM7730)
• Is investment manager connected party?
• Are there investment restrictions preventing selection?
• If PPB → Annual tax on full gains (no deferral)

STEP 4: Remittance Basis Interaction (8 min)
• If non-dom + offshore bond → gain is foreign income
• Can defer tax until remittance
• RBC implications

STEP 5: Recommendations (5 min)
• Avoid PPB status (use discretionary manager, wide investment mandate)
• Structure withdrawals within 5% allowance
• Consider remittance basis planning

     • Gain / Years held = Average annual gain
     • Calculate tax on average gain, multiply by years
     • Prevents full gain pushing into higher rate band

3. PERSONAL PORTFOLIO BOND (PPB) ANTI-AVOIDANCE

   ⚠️ CRITICAL TEST: Does IPTM7730 apply?

   A bond is a PPB if policyholder can:
   • SELECT >60% of policy investments, OR
   • Has power to VARY >60% of investments, OR
   • Uses CONNECTED investment manager

   Facts: [State whether policyholder selects investments / % control]
   _________________________________________________________________

   Analysis:
   [If >60% selection]: This IS a PPB. Anti-avoidance applies. ✗
   [If <60% selection]: This is NOT a PPB. Normal bond treatment. ✓

   PPB CONSEQUENCES:
   • Annual tax charge on ALL gains (no deferral benefit)
   • Taxed as income at marginal rates (up to 45%)
   • Loses main advantage of insurance bond wrapper

   SAFE HARBOR:
   • Use discretionary investment manager (unconnected)
   • Wide investment mandate (e.g., "balanced portfolio," "growth assets")
   • Manager makes ALL selection decisions
   • Policyholder gives only broad parameters

4. REMITTANCE BASIS (Non-Doms)

   If [Individual] is non-UK domiciled + offshore bond:

   • Bond gain is FOREIGN INCOME (s.474 ITTOIA 2005)
   • Can claim remittance basis (s.809A-809Z ITA 2007)
   • Tax deferred until gain remitted to UK
   • RBC applies if UK resident 7+ years (£30k or £60k)

   Double benefit for non-doms:
   ① Defer chargeable event (5% rule)
   ② Defer remittance (keep offshore)

5. RECOMMENDATIONS

   ✓ Avoid PPB status: Use independent discretionary manager
   ✓ Structure withdrawals within 5% allowance
   ✓ Consider chargeable event timing (e.g., low income year)
   ✓ If non-dom: Claim remittance basis + avoid remitting gain
   ✓ Document: Investment manager independence, discretion
```

### Error Prevention: Top 5 Insurance Bond Mistakes

| # | Mistake | How to Avoid | Impact |
|---|---------|--------------|--------|
| **1** | **Not identifying PPB status** | Always check: Does policyholder select >60% of investments? | -4 to -5 marks |
| **2** | **Confusing 5% with 5% of value** | 5% is of PREMIUMS PAID (cumulative), not current value | -2 to -3 marks |
| **3** | **Ignoring remittance basis for non-doms** | Offshore bond gain = foreign income eligible for RB | -3 to -4 marks |
| **4** | **Forgetting cumulative 5% allowance** | Unused allowances carry forward (e.g., Year 1: no withdrawal → Year 2: can take 10%) | -1 to -2 marks |
| **5** | **Not applying top slicing relief** | Always calculate top slicing to show tax mitigation | -2 marks |

## 2.2.4 Thin Capitalisation & Transfer Pricing Compliance

### Pattern Recognition: Spotting This Question Type

**Immediate Triggers**:
- "Thin capitalisation," "related party loan," "arm's length debt"
- "Guaranteed loan," "excessive debt," "interest deductibility"
- "Advance Thin Capitalisation Agreement (ATCA)"
- "Transfer pricing," "arm's length principle," "OECD Guidelines"
- "Master file," "local file," "Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR)"
- "TIOPA 2010 Part 4"

**Recent Exam Appearances**:
- **June 2024 Q4**: Thin Capitalisation - arm's length debt test, ATCA process (20 marks)
- **June 2022 Part C Q6**: Transfer Pricing documentation (15 marks)
- **June 2023 Part C Q6**: TP compliance, penalties, APAs (15 marks)

**Frequency**: **TP: 75% (6/8 exams) | Thin Cap: 13% (1/8 exams)**

---

### Strategic Context

**Thin Capitalisation** is a specific application of transfer pricing rules to **related party debt**. It prevents UK companies from deducting excessive interest on intra-group loans that reduce UK taxable profits.

**Key Principles**:

1. **Arm's Length Debt Test**: Would a third party lend the same amount on the same terms?
2. **Quantum**: Is the amount of debt excessive?
3. **Terms**: Is the interest rate, security, covenants at arm's length?
4. **Guaranteed Loans**: If parent guarantees third-party loan, treat as related party loan

**Transfer Pricing Compliance** extends beyond debt to ALL related party transactions (goods, services, IP, management fees).

---

### Execution Framework (Condensed)

```
STEP 1: Identify Related Party Transaction (3 min)
• Loan from parent/sister company?
• Guaranteed by related party?
• Interest rate and terms?

STEP 2: Arm's Length Test (10 min)
• Would independent lender provide same quantum?
• Is interest rate commercial?
• Apply "all factors" test:
  - Debt/equity ratio (compare to industry)
  - Covenant terms
  - Security provided
  - Financial strength of borrower
  - Purpose of loan

STEP 3: Thin Cap Adjustment (8 min)
• Determine arm's length debt amount
• Calculate disallowable interest = Interest on (Actual debt - Arm's length debt)
• Add back to taxable profits
• Interaction with Corporate Interest Restriction (CIR)

STEP 4: ATCA (if applicable) (5 min)
• Advance Thin Capitalisation Agreement = HMRC clearance
• Provides certainty on arm's length debt level
• Valid for up to 5 years
• Taxpayer must demonstrate facts/circumstances

STEP 5: TP Documentation (10 min)
• Master file (group-level TP policy)
• Local file (entity-level transactions)
• CbCR (if revenue >€750m)
• Contemporaneous documentation required
```

### Template B4: Thin Cap & Transfer Pricing Analysis (Condensed)

```
THIN CAPITALISATION ANALYSIS: [UK Company]

Legislative Framework: TIOPA 2010 Part 4 (Transfer Pricing)

1. RELATED PARTY DEBT IDENTIFICATION

   Facts:
   • [UK Company] borrowed £[X] from [Parent/Sister Company]
   • Interest rate: [X]%
   • Loan term: [X] years
   • Security: [Yes/No - describe]
   • Purpose: [State business purpose]

   Related Party? [YES/NO]
   [If parent guarantee of third-party loan → treat as related party]

2. ARM'S LENGTH TEST (s.147-166 TIOPA 2010)

   Would an independent lender lend £[X] to [UK Company] on these terms?

   FACTOR ANALYSIS:

   ① Debt/Equity Ratio
      • Actual: £[debt] / £[equity] = [ratio]
      • Industry norm: [typical ratio for sector]
      • Assessment: [Excessive / Reasonable]

   ② Financial Strength of Borrower
      • EBITDA: £[X]
      • Interest cover: EBITDA / Interest = [X]x
      • Assessment: [Can service debt? Yes/No]

   ③ Security & Covenants
      • Security provided: [Describe]
      • Covenants: [Describe financial covenants]
      • Assessment: [Typical / Weak / Strong]

   ④ Comparability
      • Would third-party lender provide same quantum?
      • Market interest rate for equivalent risk: [X]%
      • Actual rate: [X]%

   CONCLUSION:
   Arm's length debt quantum: £[X] (vs actual £[Y])
   Excessive debt: £[Y - X]

3. THIN CAP ADJUSTMENT

   Disallowable Interest Calculation:

   Actual debt                                    £[___________]
   Less: Arm's length debt                       (£[__________])
   Excessive debt                                 £[___________]

   × Interest rate                                × [X]%
   = Disallowable interest                        £[___________]

   This amount is ADDED BACK to taxable profits under s.147 TIOPA 2010.

   Interaction with CIR:
   • Thin cap adjustment made BEFORE CIR restriction
   • Remaining allowable interest subject to CIR test

4. ADVANCE THIN CAPITALISATION AGREEMENT (ATCA)

   [UK Company] can apply to HMRC for ATCA to obtain certainty.

   Process:
   • Submit application to HMRC Business, Assets & International
   • Provide: Financial projections, comparables, arm's length analysis
   • HMRC review (typically 6-12 months)
   • Agreement valid up to 5 years
   • Provides safe harbor from thin cap adjustments

   Recommendation: [Should company seek ATCA? Consider if significant debt]

5. TRANSFER PRICING DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

   ✓ MASTER FILE (if part of multinational group with revenue >€750m)
     • Group structure, business operations
     • TP policies, intangibles, financing arrangements
     • Due: 12 months after year-end

   ✓ LOCAL FILE (all material TP transactions)
     • Entity-specific transactions with related parties
     • Functional analysis, comparability, method selection
     • Must be contemporaneous (prepared before filing date)

   ✓ COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY REPORTING (CbCR)
     • If ultimate parent revenue >€750m
     • Reporting of profits, taxes, employees by jurisdiction
     • Due: 12 months after year-end

   Penalties for Non-Compliance:
   • Failure to maintain documentation: Up to £3,000
   • Inaccurate return due to TP misstatement: Up to 100% of tax understated
```

### Error Prevention: Top 5 Thin Cap/TP Mistakes

| # | Mistake | How to Avoid | Impact |
|---|---------|--------------|--------|
| **1** | **Not treating guaranteed loans as related party** | Parent guarantee = related party loan (arm's length test applies) | -3 to -4 marks |
| **2** | **Confusing thin cap with CIR** | Thin cap adjusts debt/equity; CIR limits total interest deductions | -2 to -3 marks |
| **3** | **Ignoring industry comparables** | Use debt/equity ratios from similar companies in sector | -2 marks |
| **4** | **Not calculating disallowable interest** | Always show: Excessive debt × Interest rate = Disallowable amount | -3 to -4 marks |
| **5** | **Forgetting documentation requirements** | Master file, local file, CbCR - all required for compliance | -2 marks |

*Continue to Section 2.2.5: Emerging Anti-Avoidance Regimes →*

---

## 2.2.5 Emerging Anti-Avoidance Regimes

This section covers anti-avoidance topics that have **recently appeared** or are **likely to appear** in future exams based on legislative developments.

---

### 2.2.5(a) Diverted Profits Tax (DPT)

**Pattern Recognition**:
- "Diverted Profits Tax," "DPT," "Google Tax"
- "Avoided PE," "effective tax mismatch," "insufficient economic substance"
- "25% rate," "Diverted Profits Notice"

**Recent Exam Appearances**:
- **June 2025 Part C Q9**: DPT purpose and scope, notification requirements (15 marks) - **NEW TOPIC**

**Frequency**: **13% (1/8 exams) - EMERGING**

---

**Key Features** (High-Level Overview):

**Purpose**: Combat profit shifting by multinational enterprises (MNEs), particularly digital companies avoiding UK PE.

**Two Scenarios**:
1. **Avoided PE** (s.86): Foreign company avoids UK PE through arrangements lacking economic substance
2. **Effective Tax Mismatch** (s.80): Transactions between UK company and related party in low-tax jurisdiction creating tax advantage

**DPT Rate**: **25%** (but effectively up to **55%** due to non-deductibility)

**Process**:
- HMRC issues Diverted Profits Notice
- 30-day review period
- Company can make representations
- Advance clearance not available (unlike ATCA)

**Strategic Tip**: Know the PURPOSE of DPT (deterrent to artificial arrangements), the TWO scenarios, and the 25% rate. Don't need deep technical detail for Part C.

---

### 2.2.5(b) Unallowable Purpose Rule (CIR Context)

**Pattern Recognition**:
- "Unallowable purpose," "main purpose test"
- "Corporate Interest Restriction," "CIR"
- "Tax advantage," "financing expense"

**Recent Exam Appearances**:
- **June 2025 Part A Q2**: Unallowable purpose in CIR context (5 marks within 25-mark question)

---

**Key Features**:

Part of the **Corporate Interest Restriction (CIR)** regime (TIOPA 2010 Part 10).

**Unallowable Purpose Test**:
- Disallows interest if a **main purpose** of the loan is to achieve a **tax advantage**
- Stricter than "sole purpose" - one of several main purposes is sufficient
- Examples: Loan to acquire target solely to generate UK interest deductions; cash box structures

**Application**:
- Applies BEFORE fixed ratio/group ratio rules
- Disallowed interest not eligible for carry-forward
- Subjective test - requires analysis of commercial rationale

**Strategic Tip**: Always analyze the COMMERCIAL PURPOSE of intra-group loans. If tax advantage is evident without strong business reason, unallowable purpose likely applies.

---

### 2.2.5(c) Hybrid Mismatch Rules

**Pattern Recognition**:
- "Hybrid mismatch," "dual inclusion income," "double deduction"
- "Financial instrument hybrid," "hybrid entity"
- "OECD BEPS Action 2"

**Recent Exam Appearances**:
- **December 2021 Part C Q6**: Anti-hybrid rules (15 marks)
- **June 2021 Part C Q6**: Hybrid mismatches (15 marks)

---

**Key Features** (High-Level):

**Purpose**: Prevent arrangements exploiting differences in tax treatment of entities or instruments between jurisdictions.

**Types of Mismatches**:
1. **Deduction/No Inclusion (D/NI)**: Payment deductible in one country but not taxable in other
2. **Double Deduction (DD)**: Same expense deducted in two countries
3. **Imported Mismatch**: Indirect benefit from hybrid mismatch elsewhere in group

**UK Response**: **TIOPA 2010 Part 6A** - Disallows deduction or requires inclusion to neutralize mismatch

**Strategic Tip**: Focus on IDENTIFYING the mismatch (D/NI vs DD) and understanding the UK's response (disallow deduction). Detailed technical rules are Part C level.
