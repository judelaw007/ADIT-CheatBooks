# Part B: Controlled Foreign Companies (CFCs) - TEMPLATE

## Question Recognition Triggers
- UK company with overseas subsidiaries
- Foreign company controlled by UK company/persons
- Scenarios involving low-tax jurisdictions
- Questions about "profit diversion" or "anti-avoidance"
- References to "CFC charge" or "apportionment"

## Time Allocation (20 marks = 36 minutes)
- Read and analyze: 4 minutes
- Plan structure: 2 minutes
- Write answer: 27 minutes
- Review: 3 minutes

## Answer Structure Template

### 1. Introduction and Purpose of CFC Rules (2 marks, 3 minutes)
```
The CFC rules (TIOPA 2010, Part 9A) are anti-avoidance provisions designed to prevent
UK companies from diverting UK profits to low-tax overseas subsidiaries.

If the CFC rules apply, the UK parent is charged to UK corporation tax on the CFC's
"chargeable profits" as if those profits were its own, subject to certain exemptions.

The key issue is whether [Company X] is a CFC and, if so, whether any exemptions apply
to avoid a CFC charge.
```

### 2. CFC Definition - Is There a CFC? (4-5 marks, 6-8 minutes)

#### Step 1: Residence
```
The foreign company must be non-UK resident for tax purposes (TIOPA 2010, s. 371AA).

Analysis:
[State where company is resident - apply residence tests if needed]

Conclusion: [Company] is/is not non-UK resident.
```

#### Step 2: Control
```
The foreign company must be controlled by UK persons (TIOPA 2010, s. 371AB).

Control means >50% of voting power, income rights, or capital rights (either alone or
together with connected persons).

Analysis:
[Detail ownership structure]
- Voting rights held by UK persons: [%]
- Income rights held by UK persons: [%]
- Capital rights held by UK persons: [%]

Conclusion: UK persons control [%] of [Company], meeting the control test.
```

#### Step 3: Low Profits Rate (Gateway)
```
The CFC must be subject to a "low profits rate" of tax - i.e., tax paid on profits
is less than 75% of UK tax that would have been paid (TIOPA 2010, s. 371BC).

Calculation:
- CFC's actual foreign tax: [amount] on profits of [amount] = [%] effective rate
- UK corporation tax on same profits: [amount] at [%] rate
- 75% of UK tax: [amount]

Comparison:
Foreign tax [amount] < 75% of UK tax [amount]?

Conclusion: [Company] does/does not pass through the low profits rate gateway.
```

### 3. CFC Charge Gateway (3-4 marks, 5-7 minutes)

```
If the company is a CFC, the CFC charge applies UNLESS the CFC passes through one of
the following gateways:

A. Excluded Territories Gateway (TIOPA 2010, s. 371EA)
   - Not applicable - no territories currently excluded

B. Low Profits Gateway (TIOPA 2010, s. 371EB)
   - Accounting profits ≤ £500,000 AND
   - Non-trading income ≤ £50,000

   Analysis:
   - Accounting profits: [amount]
   - Non-trading income: [amount]

   Conclusion: Low profits gateway does/does not apply.

C. Low Profit Margin Gateway (TIOPA 2010, s. 371EC)
   - Accounting profits ≤ 10% of relevant operating expenditure

   Analysis:
   - Accounting profits: [amount]
   - Operating expenditure: [amount]
   - 10% threshold: [amount]

   Conclusion: Low profit margin gateway does/does not apply.

D. Tax Exemption Gateway (TIOPA 2010, s. 371ED)
   - CFC's income is subject to local tax exemption for genuine commercial reasons

   Analysis: [Discuss if applicable]

Overall Gateway Conclusion:
[Company] does/does not pass through the [gateway name], so CFC charge rules do/do not apply.
```

### 4. If No Gateway Applies: Calculate Chargeable Profits (4-6 marks, 7-10 minutes)

```
If no gateway applies, must identify "chargeable profits" under one or more CFC charge gateways:

A. CFC Charge Gateway - Profits Attributable to UK Activities (s. 371BB)
   Applies where significant people functions (SPF) that generate profits are carried
   out in UK.

   Analysis:
   [Identify key people functions]
   [Determine where performed - UK or overseas]

   Profits attributable: [amount/none]

B. CFC Charge Gateway - Non-Trading Finance Profits (Chapter 5)
   Applies to interest, financing costs, and financial trading profits
   (subject to exemptions for qualifying loan relationships).

   Analysis:
   [Identify finance profits]
   [Check for exemptions]

   Chargeable profits: [amount]

C. CFC Charge Gateway - Trading Finance Profits (Chapter 6)
   Similar to non-trading but for trading finance activities.

D. CFC Charge Gateway - Captive Insurance (Chapter 7)
   Applies to insurance business where >50% of premiums from connected persons.

E. CFC Charge Gateway - Solo Consolidation (Chapter 8)
   Catch-all for profits that would be charged if UK company.

Analysis for this scenario:
[Identify which charge gateway(s) apply]
[Calculate chargeable profits under relevant gateway]

Total Chargeable Profits: [amount]
```

### 5. Apportionment and CFC Charge Calculation (3-4 marks, 4-6 minutes)

```
Chargeable profits are apportioned to each UK company with relevant interest in CFC
based on their percentage interest (TIOPA 2010, s. 371TA).

Apportionment:
[UK Company name] holds [%] interest in CFC

Apportioned chargeable profits: [amount] × [%] = [amount]

CFC Charge:
Apportioned profits taxed at UK corporation tax rate: [rate]%

CFC charge = [apportioned profits] × [CT rate]% = [amount]

Credit for foreign tax:
Foreign tax attributable to chargeable profits: [amount]
UK allows credit against CFC charge (TIOPA 2010, s. 371UD)

Net CFC charge payable: [CFC charge] - [foreign tax credit] = [amount]
```

### 6. Exemptions (if applicable) (2-3 marks, 3-4 minutes)

```
Even if chargeable profits exist, certain exemptions may apply:

A. Exempt Period Exemption (s. 371IA)
   - First 12 months after company becomes CFC

B. Excluded Territories Exemption
   - Not currently available

C. Low Profits Exemption (if passed gateway but calculating anyway)

D. Entity-Level Exemptions:
   - Shipping
   - Finance company partial exemption
   - Insurance

Analysis:
[State whether any exemptions apply and reduce/eliminate charge]

Final CFC charge after exemptions: [amount]
```

### 7. Conclusion and Recommendations (1-2 marks, 2-3 minutes)

```
In conclusion, [Company] is a CFC because [summarize key reasons].

[If charge applies]: The CFC charge for [UK Company] is [amount] on apportioned
chargeable profits of [amount].

[If no charge]: No CFC charge arises because [gateway/exemption applies].

Recommendations:
[Consider any restructuring, change in operations, or tax planning opportunities]
[Note any compliance obligations - filing requirements, etc.]
```

## Key Legislation References
- TIOPA 2010, Part 9A (ss. 371AA-371VH)
- CFC (Excluded Territories) Regulations 2012
- Case law: Cadbury Schweppes (CJEU) - substance requirement

## Common Variations
1. Multiple CFCs in group structure
2. CFC with exempt and chargeable profits (partial exemptions)
3. IP holding companies
4. Finance companies
5. Distribution companies

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't confuse "control" test (>50%) with "relevant interest" for apportionment
- Remember to check ALL gateways - company may pass multiple
- Apply 75% test correctly for low profits rate of tax
- Don't forget foreign tax credit against CFC charge
- Consider indirect interests through chains of companies
- Low profits gateway has TWO conditions (both must be met)

## Calculation Tips
1. Always show the 75% comparison clearly
2. State assumptions if facts unclear
3. Round appropriately (usually to nearest £)
4. Show step-by-step for apportionment
5. Remember: foreign tax credit limited to UK tax on same profits

## Marking Scheme Breakdown (Typical)
- CFC definition and gateway test: 6-8 marks
- Chargeable profits identification: 5-6 marks
- Calculation and apportionment: 4-5 marks
- Exemptions and conclusion: 3-4 marks
- Professional presentation: 1-2 marks
