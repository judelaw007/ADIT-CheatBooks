## Answer Structure Template

### 1. Introduction and Relevance (1-2 marks, 2-3 minutes)
```
Domicile is a common law concept determining an individual's permanent home for tax purposes.
It is distinct from residence and nationality.

Domicile status is relevant for:
- UK Inheritance Tax (worldwide estate vs. UK assets only)
- Income tax and CGT (eligibility for remittance basis)
- Deemed domicile rules (additional considerations)

The key issue is to determine [Individual's] domicile status for [relevant tax year/purpose].
```

### 2. Types of Domicile (2-3 marks, 3-5 minutes)

```
There are three types of domicile under common law:

A. Domicile of Origin
   - Acquired at birth (father's domicile if parents married, mother's if not)
   - Can be displaced but never extinguished - revives if domicile of choice abandoned
   - Very difficult to lose (requires clear break)

B. Domicile of Dependency
   - For children under 16, domicile follows parent's domicile
   - Changes automatically if parent's domicile changes
   - Ends at age 16 or marriage (if younger)

C. Domicile of Choice
   - Acquired by adult through residence + intention to remain permanently/indefinitely
   - Requires BOTH physical presence AND mental intention
   - Very high burden of proof to establish change

Application to [Individual]:
[Identify which type currently applies and historical domicile path]
```

### 3. Domicile of Origin Analysis (if relevant) (2-3 marks, 3-5 minutes)

```
[Individual] was born [date] in [country] to parents who were [married/unmarried].

Father's domicile at birth: [country]
Mother's domicile at birth: [country]

Rule: Domicile of origin is determined by father's domicile if legitimate child
(or mother's if illegitimate or father deceased).

Conclusion: [Individual's] domicile of origin is [country].

Note: This domicile of origin can only be displaced by acquiring a domicile of choice,
but will revive if domicile of choice is later abandoned.
```

### 4. Domicile of Choice Analysis (if relevant) (4-6 marks, 7-10 minutes)

```
To acquire domicile of choice, individual must satisfy TWO requirements:

A. RESIDENCE in the new country
   - Must be actual, lawful residence
   - No minimum time period, but longer residence = stronger evidence

B. INTENTION to remain permanently or indefinitely
   - Subjective test: genuine intention to make new country permanent home
   - Objective evidence: actions consistent with permanent residence

Standard of proof: Very high - must show definite break from domicile of origin
(IRC v Bullock; Ramsey v IRC).

Analysis for [Individual]:

Residence Factor:
- Arrived in [country] on [date]
- Period of residence: [X years]
- Nature of residence: [lawful, continuous, etc.]

Evidence of residence: [Strong/Moderate/Weak]

Intention Factor (examine objective evidence):

Evidence SUPPORTING intention to remain permanently:
- [e.g., purchased property]
- [e.g., established business]
- [e.g., joined local clubs/organizations]
- [e.g., obtained permanent residence permit/citizenship]
- [e.g., family moved with individual]
- [e.g., made will under local law]
- [e.g., severed ties with country of origin]
- [e.g., stated intention in writing]

Evidence AGAINST intention to remain permanently:
- [e.g., retained property in country of origin]
- [e.g., temporary work permit only]
- [e.g., stated intention to return eventually]
- [e.g., maintained strong ties with country of origin]
- [e.g., children educated in country of origin]

Weighing the evidence:
[Analyze the balance of evidence - which factors are stronger?]

Case law comparison:
[Reference similar cases if relevant - e.g., IRC v Bullock, Ramsey, Qazi]

Conclusion on domicile of choice:
On balance, [Individual] has/has not acquired domicile of choice in [country] because:
[Summarize key reasons]

Therefore, [Individual's] domicile is [country] (either domicile of choice or
domicile of origin if choice not established).
```

### 5. Deemed Domicile Rules (if relevant) (3-4 marks, 5-7 minutes)

```
Even if individual is NOT domiciled in UK under common law, they may be deemed UK domiciled
for certain tax purposes under statutory rules.

A. Deemed Domicile for Inheritance Tax (IHTA 1984, s. 267)

   Rule: Individual is deemed UK domiciled if:
   - UK resident in at least 15 of the 20 tax years immediately before relevant time, OR
   - Was UK domiciled within 3 years before relevant time

   Analysis for [Individual]:
   - UK residence history: [list years]
   - UK resident in [X] of last 20 years
   - Previously UK domiciled? [Yes/No - when?]

   Conclusion: [Individual] is/is not deemed UK domiciled for IHT purposes.

   Impact: If deemed domiciled, worldwide estate subject to UK IHT (not just UK assets).

B. Deemed Domicile for Income Tax and CGT (ITA 2007, s. 835BA)

   Rule: Long-term resident individual is deemed UK domiciled if:
   - UK resident in at least 15 of the last 20 tax years, AND
   - UK resident in current tax year

   Analysis for [Individual]:
   - UK resident in [X] of last 20 tax years
   - UK resident in [current year]? [Yes/No]

   Conclusion: [Individual] is/is not deemed UK domiciled for income tax/CGT purposes
   for [tax year].

   Impact:
   - Cannot claim remittance basis (even if non-domiciled under common law)
   - Subject to UK tax on worldwide income and gains
   - Offshore trust rules apply differently
```

### 6. Tax Consequences (2-3 marks, 3-4 minutes)

```
Based on domicile status determined above:

If UK domiciled (actual or deemed):
- IHT: Worldwide estate subject to UK IHT
- Income Tax/CGT: Taxed on arising basis (worldwide income/gains)
- Cannot claim remittance basis
- Offshore trusts: settlor-interested trust rules apply

If non-UK domiciled (and not deemed domiciled):
- IHT: Only UK assets ("excluded property" relief for non-UK assets)
- Income Tax/CGT: May claim remittance basis (if meet conditions)
- Offshore trusts: more favorable treatment

Specific implications for [Individual]:
[Apply to scenario - discuss specific assets, income, planning]

Planning considerations:
[Any opportunities or issues arising from domicile status]
```

### 7. Conclusion (1 mark, 1-2 minutes)

```
In conclusion, [Individual] is [UK/non-UK] domiciled [and deemed UK domiciled for
[IHT/income tax/CGT] purposes] because [key reason].

This means [summarize main tax consequences].
```

## Key Legislation and Cases
- **Common law**: No statute - case law determines domicile
- **Key cases**: IRC v Bullock; Ramsey v IRC; Qazi v HMRC; Henkes v Netherlands
- **Deemed domicile**: IHTA 1984, s. 267; ITA 2007, s. 835BA
- **Remittance basis**: ITA 2007, ss. 809A-809Z

## Common Variations

2. Domicile of choice abandoned (reverts to domicile of origin)
3. Multiple changes of domicile
4. Recent deemed domicile rule changes
5. Interaction with residence status

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't confuse domicile with residence or nationality
- Remember: domicile of origin NEVER dies (only displaced)
- Burden of proof to change domicile is very high
- Deemed domicile rules differ for IHT vs. income tax/CGT
