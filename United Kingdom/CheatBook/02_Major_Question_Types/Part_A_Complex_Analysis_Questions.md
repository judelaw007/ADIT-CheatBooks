# CHAPTER 02: MAJOR QUESTION TYPES

## PART A: Complex Analysis Questions (50 marks)

### Overview: The High-Stakes Backbone

Part A questions are the **heaviest weighted** section of the ADIT UK exam, accounting for **50 out of 100 marks** (50% of your total score). You must answer **BOTH questions** in Part A, with each worth 25 marks.

**Time Allocation**: You should spend approximately **90 minutes** (1.5 hours) on Part A—about **45 minutes per question** based on the 1.8 minutes-per-mark rule.

### Strategic Importance

From Chapter 01, you learned that certain topics appear with remarkable consistency:

| Topic | Frequency (2020-2025) | Strategic Priority |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Individual Residence (SRT)** | 100% (8/8 exams) | CRITICAL - GUARANTEED |
| **Domicile** | 88% (7/8 exams) | CRITICAL |
| **Remittance Basis** | 75% (6/8 exams) | CRITICAL |
| **Corporate Residence & PE** | 63% (5/8 exams) | HIGH |
| **Permanent Establishment** | 63% (5/8 exams) | HIGH |

**Key Insight**: If you master the templates in this chapter for Individual Residence, Corporate Residence/PE, and Remittance Basis, you will be prepared for approximately **75-80% of all Part A questions**.

### Part A Question Characteristics

**Common Features:**
- **Fact-dense scenarios** (200-400 words of facts)
- **Multi-jurisdictional** (typically involving 2-3 countries)
- **Multi-part requirements** (usually 2-4 sub-questions)
- **Integrated topics** (e.g., residence + treaty + temporary non-residence)
- **Recent legislative changes** (examiners love testing new rules)

**What Examiners Reward** (from Examiner Psychology):
1. **Structured analysis** - Clear headings and logical flow (10-15% of marks)
2. **Application to facts** - Linking rules to specific scenario details (40-45% of marks)
3. **Correct legislation citations** - FA 2013 Sch 45, s.809VA ITA 2007, etc. (10-15% of marks)
4. **Balanced conclusions** - "On balance..." or "Insufficient facts to determine conclusively..." (10-15% of marks)
5. **Professional skepticism** - Identifying risks and alternative interpretations (5-10% of marks)

**What Examiners Penalize:**
- ❌ Knowledge dumping without application to facts
- ❌ Ignoring specific facts provided in the question
- ❌ Failing to answer all parts of multi-part questions
- ❌ Generic statements without technical depth
- ❌ Poor structure making marking difficult

### Execution Priorities for Exam Day

**During Reading Time / First 10 Minutes:**

1. **Identify the topic instantly** (use pattern recognition guides below)
2. **Scan for legislation dates** (recent changes = high probability of being tested)
3. **Count the sub-parts** (ensure you allocate time to answer ALL parts)
4. **Flag facts requiring calculations** (day counts, tax computations, etc.)
5. **Choose your stronger question first** if both are unfamiliar

**During Answer Time:**

```
Minute 0-5:    Plan structure, identify template to use
Minute 5-35:   Execute template (write main answer)
Minute 35-40:  Add specific facts, calculations, legislation citations
Minute 40-43:  Conclusion and professional skepticism points
Minute 43-45:  Quality check (all parts answered? citations included?)
```

**Recovery Tactics:**
- If stuck on Part 1 of a question, move to Part 2 - don't lose marks you CAN earn
- If running out of time, switch to bullet points with legislation references
- Always provide a conclusion even if brief - easier marks than detailed analysis

## Template Matrix: Quick Selection Guide

Use this matrix to instantly identify which template to deploy:

| Question Trigger Words | Template to Use | Typical Marks | Time Allocation |
|------------------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| "Individual," "days in UK," "Statutory Residence Test," "SRT," "ties" | **2.1.2 Individual Residence** | 15-25 marks | 25-30 min |
| "Company," "incorporated," "central management and control," "board meetings," "dual resident" | **2.1.1 Corporate Residence** | 10-20 marks | 20-25 min |
| "Branch," "fixed place," "office," "agency," "conclude contracts," "preparatory or auxiliary" | **2.1.3 Permanent Establishment** | 10-20 marks | 15-20 min |
| "Non-domiciled," "remittance," "foreign income/gains," "arising basis," "RBC," "mixed funds" | **2.1.4 Remittance Basis** | 15-25 marks | 20-25 min |
| "Credit relief," "foreign tax," "double taxation," "temporary non-residence," "left UK," "returning to UK" | **2.1.5 DTR & TNR** | 5-15 marks | 15-20 min |
| "Double tax agreement," "treaty," "tie-breaker," "OECD Model," "Article 4," "POEM" | **2.1.1 + Treaty Overlay** | 5-10 marks | 10-12 min |

**Integration Alert**: Part A questions often **combine** multiple templates. For example:
- Individual Residence (2.1.2) + Treaty Tie-Breaker (2.1.1) + TNR (2.1.5) = 25 marks
- Corporate Residence (2.1.1) + PE (2.1.3) + WHT/Dividends = 25 marks

## 2.1.1 Corporate Residence & Treaty Tie-Breaker

### Pattern Recognition: Spotting This Question Type

**Immediate Triggers** (if you see these words, deploy this template):
- "Company," "incorporated," "Ltd," "SA," "Inc," "GmbH," "Plc"
- "Board meetings," "directors," "central management and control"
- "Strategic decisions," "place of effective management"
- "Dual resident," "treaty tie-breaker," "Article 4"
- "Incorporated in [Country X] but managed from [Country Y]"

**Recent Exam Appearances**:
- June 2025 Q2: Solaris Future SA (Spain incorporation, UK board meetings potential)
- December 2024: (check pattern)
- June 2024: (check pattern)
-Frequency: **63% (5/8 exams 2020-2025)**

**Mark Range**: Typically **10-20 marks** when tested

---

### Strategic Context

**Why This Matters:**
- Corporate residence determines **worldwide tax liability scope**
- Dual residence creates **severe double taxation risk** (no treaty protection)
- UK uses **Central Management and Control (CMC)** test (case law-based)
- Treaties use **Place of Effective Management (POEM)** tie-breaker (OECD Model Article 4)
- **NEW RISK**: Examiners increasingly test scenarios where incorporation ≠ management location

**Time Allocation Strategy:**
- **Standalone corporate residence question**: 15-20 minutes
- **Integrated with PE/dividends/unallowable purpose**: Add 10-15 minutes
- **Treaty tie-breaker analysis**: Add 8-10 minutes

**Difficulty vs. Return Assessment:**
- **Difficulty**: Medium (requires knowledge of case law + treaty)
- **Return**: High (marks come easily if you structure correctly)
- **Efficiency Gain**: Use the template structure below = save 5-7 minutes

### Template & Tools

**TEMPLATE A: Corporate Residence Analysis**

```
CORPORATE RESIDENCE ANALYSIS: [Company Name]

1. INCORPORATION TEST (CTA 2009 s.14)
   
   [Company Name] is incorporated in [Country].
   
   [If UK]: Under s.14 CTA 2009, a company incorporated in the UK is 
   conclusively UK tax resident, regardless of where management is located.
   Therefore, [Company] is UK resident.
   
   [If Foreign]: Under s.14 CTA 2009, [Company] is not UK resident by 
   incorporation. Must consider Central Management and Control test.

2. CENTRAL MANAGEMENT & CONTROL TEST (De Beers Case Law)
   
   Under UK case law (De Beers Consolidated Mines v Howe [1906]), a company  
   is resident where its "real business is carried on," determined by where
   central management and control is located.
   
   Central management and control is located where:
   • Strategic decisions are made ✓/✗
   • Board meetings are held ✓/✗  
   • Directors exercise control ✓/✗
   
   Analysis of facts:
   
   Board Meetings: [State where held, how often, what decisions made]
   → [Fact]: ___________________________________________
   
   Strategic Decisions: [Identify where key decisions are ACTUALLY made]
   → [Fact]: ___________________________________________
   
   Directors' Location: [Note residence of directors, particularly chairman]
   → [Fact]: ___________________________________________
   
   Conclusion: Central management and control is located in [Country] 
   because [reason]. Therefore, [Company] is [Country] tax resident under
   the CMC test.

3. DUAL RESIDENCE ASSESSMENT
   
   [Company] appears to be tax resident in:
   • [Country 1] under [incorporation / CMC / domestic law]
   • [Country 2] under [incorporation / CMC / domestic law]
   
   [If dual resident]: This creates dual residence, which means:
   ⚠️ WARNING: Dual resident companies are excluded from treaty protection
   under most UK DTAs. This creates severe double taxation risk as both
   countries can tax worldwide profits with no relief mechanism.
   
   [If NOT dual resident]: No dual residence issue. Proceed to treaty 
   tie-breaker if both countries claim residence under domestic law.

4. TREATY TIE-BREAKER (If Applicable - OECD Model Article 4(3))
   
   If both [Country A] and [Country B] consider [Company] resident under
   their respective domestic laws, the treaty tie-breaker applies.
   
   Under Article 4(3) of the [Country A]-[Country B] DTA (which follows
   OECD Model), a dual resident company is deemed resident solely in the
   country where its "place of effective management" (POEM) is located.
   
   POEM is where key management and commercial decisions necessary for
   conducting the company's business are made.
   
   Factors indicating POEM location:
   • Where do directors meet? → [Answer with facts]
   • Where are strategic decisions implemented? → [Answer]
   • Where are senior executives located? → [Answer]  
   • Where are key business functions performed? → [Answer]
   
   Conclusion: The POEM is located in [Country] because [reasons based on
   facts]. Therefore, [Company] is treaty resident in [Country] only.
   
   [If unclear]: Insufficient facts to conclusively determine POEM. The
   competent authorities of [Country A] and [Country B] would need to 
   reach agreement via Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) under Article 25
   of the DTA.

5. TAX CONSEQUENCES
   
   As a [Country] tax resident company, [Company] is liable to:
   • [Country] corporation tax on worldwide profits
   • [List specific obligations: filing, payments, etc.]
   • [Note any PE risks in other jurisdictions]
   
6. RECOMMENDATIONS
   
   [If dual residence risk]: Urgently restructure to ensure clear single
   residence. Options include:
   • Relocating board meetings exclusively to one jurisdiction
   • Ensuring strategic decisions made only in [jurisdiction]
   • [Other substance-based recommendations]
   
   [If CMC creates unintended UK residence]: Consider:
   • Relocating directors / board meetings
   • Ensuring UK directors are minority / non-executive
   • Using technology for remote board participation from [home country]
```

### Worked Example: June 2025 Question 2 (Extract)

**QUESTION FACTS** (Simplified - see full question in past papers):

*Solaris Future SA is a solar panel manufacturing company, incorporated and tax resident in Spain. Under Option 2, Solaris UK Ltd will be incorporated in the UK. The board of Solaris UK Ltd will include both UK and Spanish-resident directors, but all board meetings will take place in London.*

**EXAMINER REQUIREMENT**: "The UK corporate tax implications of Option 2."

**TEMPLATE APPLICATION** (with annotations):

---

**ANSWER** (using Template A above):

**CORPORATE RESIDENCE ANALYSIS: Solaris UK Ltd (Option 2)**

**1. INCORPORATION TEST (CTA 2009 s.14)**

Solaris UK Ltd will be incorporated in the United Kingdom.

Under s.14 CTA 2009, a company incorporated in the UK is conclusively UK tax resident, regardless of where its management and control is located. Therefore, **Solaris UK Ltd will be UK tax resident by virtue of incorporation**.

[Annotation: ✓ Quick win - 1-2 marks for citing correct statute and applying to facts]

**2. CENTRAL MANAGEMENT & CONTROL TEST** 

For completeness, I also consider the Central Management and Control (CMC) test, which is based on case law (De Beers Consolidated Mines v Howe [1906]).

Analysis of facts:

**Board Meetings**: All board meetings of Solaris UK Ltd will take place in London (UK).

**Directors' Location**: The board includes both UK-resident and Spanish-resident directors.

**Strategic Decisions**: There is no indication that strategic decisions affecting Solaris UK Ltd are made outside the UK. All decisions appear to be made in London at board meetings.

**Conclusion**: Central management and control of Solaris UK Ltd is located in the UK. This confirms UK tax residence (though this is already conclusive under the incorporation test).

[Annotation: ✓ Shows thoroughness - examiners like seeing both tests even if one is conclusive. Adds 2-3 marks.]

**3. PLACE OF EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT (POEM)**

The question refers to Spanish tax residence. If Spain also considers Solaris UK Ltd tax resident under Spanish domestic law (which is unlikely given UK incorporation and London management), then the POEM test under Article 4(3) of the OECD Model DTA would apply.

However, based on the facts:
- The company is incorporated in the UK
- All board meetings are in London  
- Both central management and control AND place of effective management are clearly in the UK

Therefore, there is no risk of dual residence. The DTA tie-breaker is not required. Solaris UK Ltd is solely UK tax resident.

[Annotation: ✓ Professional skepticism - addressing potential treaty issue even though unlikely. Shows examiner you've thought about all angles. Worth 1-2 marks.]

**4. TAX CONSEQUENCES**

As a UK tax resident company, Solaris UK Ltd will be liable to:

✓ **UK Corporation Tax** on its worldwide profits (s.5 CTA 2009)
✓ **Filing obligations**: Annual CT600 corporate tax return
✓ **Transfer pricing compliance**: All transactions with related parties (Solaris Future SA) must be at arm's length (TIOPA 2010 Part 4)
✓ **Quarterly installment payments**: If profits exceed £1.5m (large company threshold)

[Annotation: ✓ Specific consequences = strong application. Worth 4-5 marks in this type of question.]

**5. RISK: DUAL RESIDENCE OF PARENT (Solaris Future SA)**

⚠️ **IMPORTANT RISK**: The question states some board meetings of Solaris Future SA (the Spanish parent) will be held in the UK.

If strategic decisions for Solaris Future SA are made in the UK, this could result in the Spanish parent company being UK tax resident under the CMC test, even though it is incorporated in Spain.

This would create dual residence:
- Spain would consider Solaris Future SA resident under Spanish law
- UK would consider it resident under CMC test
- **Dual resident companies are excluded from DTA protection**
- Risk of unrelieved double taxation on worldwide profits

**RECOMMENDATION**: Solaris Future SA should NOT hold board meetings in the UK. All strategic decisions should be made exclusively in Spain to preserve Spanish-only tax residence.

[Annotation: ✓✓ Gold star answer - spotting the risk not explicitly asked about shows deep understanding. Examiners LOVE this. Can earn 3-5 bonus marks for professional skepticism.]

**MARK ALLOCATION** (Estimated based on suggested solutions):

| Element | Marks |
|---------|-------|
| Correct citation of s.14 CTA 2009 | 1-2 |
| Application: UK incorporation = UK residence | 2 |
| CMC test explanation (even if not needed) | 2-3 |
| Application of CMC to facts | 2-3 |
| Tax consequences (CT, filing, TP) | 4-5 |
| Dual residence risk identification (parent) | 3-4 |
| Recommendations | 2 |
| **TOTAL** | **16-21/25** |

**Time Taken**: Approximately 18-22 minutes for this level of answer

### Error Prevention: Top 10 Mistakes

**MISTAKE #1**: "Assuming UK incorporation alone is sufficient - not addressing CMC"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Company is UK incorporated so it's UK resident." [Stop]
- ✅ **Correct**: State s.14 CTA 2009, THEN discuss CMC for completeness
- **Why it matters**: Shows thorough understanding, earns extra marks

**MISTAKE #2**: "Confusing Central Management & Control (CMC) with Place of Effective Management (POEM)"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Using these terms interchangeably  
- ✅ **Correct**: CMC = UK domestic law test; POEM = treaty tie-breaker test
- **Prevention**: Always clarify which test you're applying and why

**MISTAKE #3**: "Ignoring dual residence risk"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Not flagging when company appears resident in 2+ countries
- ✅ **Correct**: Explicitly state "dual residence" and warn of no treaty protection
- **Why critical**: This is a major risk that loses significant marks if missed

**MISTAKE #4**: "Citing wrong legislation"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Under FA 2013..." (that's SRT for individuals!)
- ✅ **Correct**: CTA 2009 s.14-18 for corporate residence
- **Prevention**: Memorize key statutes - write them on scrap paper at start of exam

**MISTAKE #5**: "Failing to apply treaty tie-breaker when both countries claim residence"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Company is resident in both UK and Spain." [Stop]
- ✅ **Correct**: Apply Article 4(3) POEM test to determine single treaty residence
- **Why it matters**: Treaty analysis worth 4-6 marks typically

**MISTAKE #6**: "Describing what should happen, not what the facts show"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Board meetings should be held in Spain..."
- ✅ **Correct**: "The facts state board meetings ARE held in [location]..."
- **Golden Rule**: Answer based on facts AS GIVEN, not as they should be

**MISTAKE #7**: "Knowledge dumping without application"
- ❌ **Wrong**: 3 paragraphs about De Beers case + no mention of actual facts
- ✅ **Correct**: 1 sentence citing De Beers + 2 paragraphs applying to specific facts
- **Ratio**: 20% law / 80% application = optimal mark conversion

**MISTAKE #8**: "Missing the 'substance' red flags"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Ignoring facts like "short-term rental," "no role in negotiating contracts"
- ✅ **Correct**: Flag lack of substance → risk of CMC in another country
- **Examiner loves**: When you spot planning risks not explicitly asked about

**MISTAKE #9**: "Forgetting to distinguish 'formal approval' vs 'actual decision-making'"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Board formally approves in Spain so CMC is Spain"
- ✅ **Correct**: "Real decisions made in UK → CMC in UK (rubber-stamp approval in Spain irrelevant)"
- **Case law basis**: Wood v Holden [2006] - where REAL control exercised

**MISTAKE #10**: "Running out of time - no conclusion"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Detailed analysis + no conclusion at end
- ✅ **Correct**: Even if short of time, write: "Conclusion: [Company] is UK resident because [1-2 reasons]"
- **Why critical**: Conclusions worth 2-3 marks and take 30 seconds to write

### Quick Reference: Key Legislation & Cases

**Statutes** (memorize these):
- **CTA 2009 s.14**: Company incorporated in UK = UK resident
- **CTA 2009 s.15**: Registration in UK (for foreign companies)
- **CTA 2009 s.18**: Double tax agreements override domestic law
- **TIOPA 2010**: Treaty provisions (Article 4 residence)

**Case Law** (know principles):
- **De Beers Consolidated Mines v Howe [1906]**: CMC = where real business carried on
- **Unit Construction v Bullock [1960]**: CMC = where control actually exercised
- **Untelrab Ltd v McGregor [1996]**: Ordinary residence for companies (now replaced by CMC)
- **Wood v Holden [2006]**: Directors must ACTUALLY exercise control, not rubber-stamp
- **Development Securities [1971]**: Real vs nominal control

**Treaty Articles** (OECD Model):
- **Article 4(1)**: Definition of resident (person liable to tax by reason of domicile, residence, POEM)
- **Article 4(3)**: Dual resident companies - tie-breaker using POEM
- **Article 25**: Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) if competent authorities cannot agree

## 2.1.2 Individual Residence - Statutory Residence Test (SRT)

### Pattern Recognition: Spotting This Question Type

**Immediate Triggers** (if you see these words, deploy this template):
- "Individual," "days in UK," "Statutory Residence Test," "SRT"
- "Family tie," "accommodation tie," "work tie," "90-day tie," "country tie"
- "Automatic overseas test," "automatic UK test," "sufficient ties test"
- "Split year treatment," "leaver," "arriver"
- Day counting scenarios with multiple countries
- References to spouse/children residence status

**Exam Frequency**: **100% (8/8 exams from 2020-2025)** 🎯

**Recent Exam Appearances**:
- **June 2025 Q1**: Daniel Door (complex SRT with medical emergency, 2 ties, TNR)
- December 2024: (Individual residence question)
- June 2024: (Individual residence question)
- **Pattern**: GUARANTEED to appear in every exam

**Mark Range**: **15-25 marks** (often the highest-scoring Part A question)

---

### Strategic Context

**Why This Is THE Most Important Template:**

✓ Appears in **100% of exams** - you WILL face this question
✓ Highest mark allocation (typically 15-25 marks)
✓ Extremely formula-driven - easiest marks if you know the template
✓ Examiner reports show this is where candidates lose most marks through:
  - Incorrect day counting
  - Missing ties
  - Not applying all three tests in correct order
  - Forgetting split year treatment

**Time Allocation Strategy:**
- **Standalone SRT analysis**: 25-30 minutes
- **Integrated with treaty tie-breaker**: Add 8-10 minutes  
- **Integrated with TNR**: Add 5-8 minutes
- **Total for typical Part A question**: 30-40 minutes

**Difficulty vs. Return Assessment:**
- **Difficulty**: Medium-High (lots of moving parts, easy to make errors)
- **Return**: VERY HIGH (18-22 marks achievable with template)
- **Efficiency Gain**: Master this template = pass the exam (not exaggerating!)

### The SRT: Hierarchical Three-Test Structure

**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING**: The SRT has **3 tests** that must be applied in **strict order**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TEST 1: AUTOMATIC OVERSEAS TEST                            │
│  If ANY test passed → STOP → Individual is NON-UK resident  │
│  • 3 sub-tests (46-day, 16-day, full-time work abroad)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↓ If no test passed
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TEST 2: AUTOMATIC UK RESIDENCE TEST                         │
│  If ANY test passed → STOP → Individual is UK resident      │
│  • 3 sub-tests (183-day, only home, full-time work UK)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↓ If no test passed
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TEST 3: SUFFICIENT TIES TEST                                │
│  Count ties + UK days → determine residence                 │
│  • 5 possible ties (family, accommodation, work, 90-day,    │
│    country)                                                  │
│  • Different thresholds for "arrivers" vs "leavers"        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Golden Rule**: Always apply in this order. Never skip to Sufficient Ties Test without checking Automatic tests first!

---

### Execution Framework

**PHASE 1: Preparation (5 minutes)**

```
STEP 1: Count Days in UK (2 min)
• Only count days present in UK at midnight
• EXCLUDE: Days in transit, exceptional circumstances (very limited)
• INCLUDE: Days in hospital if deliberate choice to come to UK
• Create simple table showing breakdown by month/country
• Check for split year treatment eligibility

STEP 2: Identify Individual's Status (1 min)
• "Arriver" = non-resident in ALL of previous 3 tax years
• "Leaver" = resident in 1 or MORE of previous 3 tax years
• This determines which Sufficient Ties thresholds apply

STEP 3: Note Family Facts (2 min)
• Spouse/civil partner residence status
• Minor children residence status
• Where accommodation is available
• Work patterns (>3 hours on X days)
• Previous year UK days
```

**PHASE 2: Apply the Three Tests (15-20 minutes)**

**TEST 1: AUTOMATIC OVERSEAS TEST** (3 minutes)

Apply each sub-test in turn:

**Sub-Test A: Non-resident in all of previous 3 years + <46 UK days**
```
IF (non-resident 3 prior years) AND (UK days < 46)
THEN → Automatically NON-UK resident → STOP
```

**Sub-Test B: Resident in 1+ of previous 3 years + <16 UK days**
```
IF (resident in 1+ prior years) AND (UK days < 16)  
THEN → Automatically NON-UK resident → STOP
```

**Sub-Test C: Full-time work abroad + <91 UK days + <31 UK work days**
```
IF (work abroad full-time) AND (UK days < 91) AND (UK work days < 31)
THEN → Automatically NON-UK resident → STOP

Full-time work = average 35+ hours/week over period
UK work day = work >3 hours in UK on that day
```

**If NONE of the Automatic Overseas tests are met → proceed to Test 2**

---

**TEST 2: AUTOMATIC UK RESIDENCE TEST** (3 minutes)

Apply each sub-test in turn:

**Sub-Test A: 183+ days in UK**
```
IF UK days ≥ 183
THEN → Automatically UK resident → STOP
```

**Sub-Test B: Only home in UK**
```
IF (has home in UK for 91+ days) AND (present in UK home on 30+ days)
   AND (no overseas home OR overseas home <30 days)
THEN → Automatically UK resident → STOP

"Home" = building/vessel available for 91+ days continuously
Present = spend time there on separate days (not nights)
```

**Sub-Test C: Full-time work in UK**
```
IF (work in UK full-time over 365-day period) 
   AND (more than 75% of work days are UK work days)
   AND (at least 1 UK work day in tax year)
THEN → Automatically UK resident → STOP

Full-time = average 35+ hours/week
UK work day = work >3 hours in UK on that day
```

**If NONE of the Automatic UK tests are met → proceed to Test 3**

---

**TEST 3: SUFFICIENT TIES TEST** (10-15 minutes)

**STEP 1: Identify All Ties (8 minutes)**

Work through each tie systematically:

**TIE 1: FAMILY TIE** ✓ / ✗
```
Condition: Spouse/civil partner OR minor children are UK resident

Key points:
• Spouse must be UK resident in their OWN right under SRT
  (not just because individual is resident!)
• Minor children = under 18 at START of tax year
• Children at boarding school = still count
• Separated/estranged spouse = no tie

Evidence needed from facts:
- Where does spouse/partner live?
- How many days does spouse spend in UK?
- Are there minor children? Where do they live/go to school?

→ TIE EXISTS if: _____ (explain based on facts)
```

**TIE 2: ACCOMMODATION TIE** ✓ / ✗
```
Condition: UK accommodation available for 91+ consecutive days AND
           individual present on 1+ nights in tax year

Types of accommodation:
• Owned or rented property
• Available for use (even if not used every day)
• Family/friend's property if available AND used on 16+ nights

Evidence needed from facts:
- Does individual own/rent UK property?
- Available for how long continuously?
- Did they stay there in the tax year?
- Any stays at family/friend homes?

→ TIE EXISTS if: _____ (explain based on facts)
```

**TIE 3: WORK TIE** ✓ / ✗
```
Condition: Works in UK on 40+ days (>3 hours per day)

Calculation:
• Count each day where individual works >3 hours in UK
• Includes employed and self-employed work
• Excludes: incidental work, < 3 hours

Evidence needed from facts:
- How many days worked in UK?
- Hours per day?
- Nature of work?

→ TIE EXISTS if: _____ (explain based on facts)
```

**TIE 4: 90-DAY TIE** ✓ / ✗
```
Condition: Spent >90 days in UK in EITHER of previous 2 tax years

Calculation:
• Look back at year before last (Y-2)
• Look back at last year (Y-1)
• If EITHER year had >90 UK days → tie exists

Evidence needed from facts:
- How many UK days in prior 2 years?
- Any mention of "previously spent X days in UK"?

→ TIE EXISTS if: _____ (explain based on facts)
```

**TIE 5: COUNTRY TIE** ✓ / ✗
```
Condition: Spends more days in UK than in any OTHER single country

Only applies to "leavers" (not arrivers)

Calculation:
• Count days in each country during tax year
• Compare UK days with highest other country
• If UK > any other single country → tie exists

Evidence needed from facts:
- Day breakdown by country?
- Which country had most days?

→ TIE EXISTS if: _____ (explain based on facts)
```

**STEP 2: Count Total Ties** (1 minute)

```
TOTAL TIES FOR [NAME]: ___ / 5

✓ Family Tie: Yes/No
✓ Accommodation Tie: Yes/No  
✓ Work Tie: Yes/No
✓ 90-Day Tie: Yes/No
✓ Country Tie: Yes/No (only for leavers)
```

**STEP 3: Apply Day/Tie Matrix** (2 minutes)

**For LEAVERS** (resident in 1+ of previous 3 years):

| UK Days | Ties Needed | Result |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| < 16 | Any | Non-resident (Automatic Overseas) |
| 16-45 | 4+ ties required | Check tie count |
| 46-90 | 3+ ties required | Check tie count |
| 91-120 | 2+ ties required | Check tie count |
| 121-182 | 1+ tie required | Check tie count |
| 183+ | Any | UK resident (Automatic UK) |

**For ARRIVERS** (non-resident in all previous 3 years):

| UK Days | Ties Needed | Result |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| < 46 | Any | Non-resident (Automatic Overseas) |
| 46-90 | 4+ ties required | Check tie count |
| 91-120 | 3+ ties required | Check tie count |
| 121-182 | 2+ ties required | Check tie count |
| 183+ | Any | UK resident (Automatic UK) |

**Application:**
```
[Name] is a [LEAVER / ARRIVER]
[Name] spent [X] days in UK in 202X/2X
[Name] has [Y] ties

Applying the matrix:
- Days in UK: [X] → Falls in bracket [16-45 / 46-90 / 91-120 / 121-182]
- Ties required for UK residence: [Z]
- Ties present: [Y]

CONCLUSION:
[If Y ≥ Z]: Individual IS UK resident (has sufficient ties)
[If Y < Z]: Individual is NOT UK resident (insufficient ties)
```

---

**PHASE 3: Additional Considerations** (5 minutes)

**Split Year Treatment**

If individual arrives in/leaves UK during tax year:
```
Check if split year applies:
• Case 1: Starts full-time work abroad
• Case 2: Partner starts full-time work abroad  
• Case 3: Ceases to have UK home
• Case 4: Starts to have UK home only
• Case 5: Starts full-time work in UK
• Case 6: Ceases full-time work abroad
• Case 7: Partner ceases full-time work abroad
• Case 8: Starts to have UK home

If split year applies:
- Part of year = UK resident
- Part of year = non-UK resident
- Specify which part is which
```

**Treaty Tie-Breaker** (if dual resident)

If UK resident under SRT AND resident under another country's domestic law:
```
Apply OECD Model Article 4(2) tie-breaker (for individuals):

1. Permanent home test
   → Where is individual's permanent home available?
   
2. Centre of vital interests (if homes in both)
   → Where are personal/economic ties closer?
   
3. Habitual abode (if unclear)
   → Where does individual habitually live?
   
4. Nationality
   → Which country's citizenship held?

Conclusion: Treaty residence is in [Country]
```

[If FAILED]: [Name] is not automatically UK resident.
→ PROCEED TO SUFFICIENT TIES TEST

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PART C: SUFFICIENT TIES TEST

[Only complete if both Automatic tests failed]

Under FA 2013 Sch 45 Part 4, residence is determined by the number
of "ties" to the UK combined with days spent in the UK.

STEP 1: IDENTIFY TIES

TIE 1: FAMILY TIE

Conditions:
• Spouse/civil partner is UK resident (under SRT), OR
• Minor children (<18 at start of tax year) are UK resident

Analysis of facts:

Spouse/Partner: [Name]
- Days in UK 202X/2X: [X] days
- Residence status under SRT: [Describe - is spouse UK resident?]
- Family tie conclusion: [Yes, spouse is UK resident / No]

Minor Children:
- Number of minor children: [X]
- Where resident: [UK / Overseas / Mix]
- Days in UK: [Describe]
- Family tie conclusion: [Yes, children UK resident / No]

→ FAMILY TIE: [EXISTS / DOES NOT EXIST]

Reasoning: [Explain based on facts]

---

TIE 2: ACCOMMODATION TIE  

Conditions:
• UK accommodation available for 91+ consecutive days in tax year, AND
• Individual present in accommodation on 1+ nights in tax year
• (OR) Family/friend accommodation used 16+ nights

Analysis of facts:

UK Property Owned/Rented:
- Address/type: [Describe]
- Available for: [X] days continuously
- Individual present: [Y] nights in tax year

Family/Friend Accommodation:
- Any stays at family/friend homes: [Yes/No]
- If yes, total nights: [Z]

→ ACCOMMODATION TIE: [EXISTS / DOES NOT EXIST]

Reasoning: [Explain based on facts]

---

TIE 3: WORK TIE

Condition:
• Works in UK >3 hours on 40+ days in tax year

Analysis of facts:

UK Work Pattern:
- Nature of work: [Describe]
- Days worked >3 hours in UK: [X] days
- Threshold: 40 days

→ WORK TIE: [EXISTS / DOES NOT EXIST]

Reasoning: [Explain based on facts]

---

TIE 4: 90-DAY TIE

Condition:
• Spent >90 days in UK in EITHER of the 2 preceding tax years

Analysis of facts:

Tax year 202X-2/2X-1: [X] UK days [>90 / ≤90]
Tax year 202X-1/2X: [Y] UK days [>90 / ≤90]

→ 90-DAY TIE: [EXISTS / DOES NOT EXIST]

Reasoning: [Explain based on facts]

---

TIE 5: COUNTRY TIE (only applies to "leavers")

[Skip this section if individual is an "arriver"]

Condition:
• Spends more days in UK than in any other single country

Analysis of facts:

Days by country in 202X/2X:
UK:            [X] days
[Country Y]:   [Y] days
[Country Z]:   [Z] days
[Other]:       [W] days

Highest non-UK country: [Country Y] with [Y] days
UK days: [X]

Comparison: UK days [greater than / less than / equal to] [Country Y]

→ COUNTRY TIE: [EXISTS / DOES NOT EXIST]

Reasoning: [Explain based on facts]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 2: COUNT TIES

TOTAL TIES FOR [NAME]: [X] / [4 or 5]

Summary:
✓ Family Tie:         [YES / NO]
✓ Accommodation Tie:  [YES / NO]
✓ Work Tie:           [YES / NO]
✓ 90-Day Tie:         [YES / NO]
✓ Country Tie:        [YES / NO - or N/A if arriver]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 3: APPLY SUFFICIENT TIES MATRIX

[Name] is a [LEAVER / ARRIVER]
[Name] spent [X] days in UK
[Name] has [Y] ties to UK

Applicable Matrix:

[If LEAVER - use this table]:

| UK Days     | Ties Required | [Name's Position]        |
|-------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| < 16        | Any           | Automatic overseas       |
| 16 - 45     | 4+ ties       | [X] days, [Y] ties      |
| 46 - 90     | 3+ ties       | [X] days, [Y] ties      |
| 91 - 120    | 2+ ties       | [X] days, [Y] ties      |
| 121 - 182   | 1+ tie        | [X] days, [Y] ties      |
| 183+        | Any           | Automatic UK             |

[If ARRIVER - use this table]:

| UK Days     | Ties Required | [Name's Position]        |
|-------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| < 46        | Any           | Automatic overseas       |
| 46 - 90     | 4+ ties       | [X] days, [Y] ties      |
| 91 - 120    | 3+ ties       | [X] days, [Y] ties      |
| 121 - 182   | 2+ ties       | [X] days, [Y] ties      |
| 183+        | Any           | Automatic UK             |

Application:

Days in UK: [X] → Falls in bracket [[16-45] / [46-90] / [91-120] / [121-182]]
Ties required for UK residence: [Z]+
Ties present: [Y]

Comparison: [Y] ties [IS ≥ / IS < ] [Z] ties required

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FINAL CONCLUSION

Based on the Statutory Residence Test analysis:

[Name] [IS / IS NOT] UK tax resident for tax year 202X/2X.

Basis of determination:
[Automatic Overseas Test / Automatic UK Test / Sufficient Ties Test]

Reasoning:
[Provide 2-3 sentence summary of key facts leading to conclusion]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

[Include these sections if relevant to facts]:

1. SPLIT YEAR TREATMENT

[If individual arrives/leaves during year, check split year cases]

Applicable split year case: [Case 1-8 or None]

If split year applies:
- UK resident part: [Date range]
- Non-UK resident part: [Date range]

2. TREATY TIE-BREAKER (If dual resident under domestic laws)

[If both UK SRT and foreign country determine residence, apply treaty]

Article 4(2) OECD Model tie-breaker:
1. Permanent home: [Analysis]
2. Centre of vital interests: [Analysis]
3. Habitual abode: [Analysis]
4. Nationality: [Analysis]

Treaty residence conclusion: [Country]

3. CONSEQUENCES OF RESIDENCE STATUS

As a [UK resident / non-UK resident] for 202X/2X:

[If UK resident]:
• Liable to UK tax on worldwide income and gains
• [If also non-domiciled: may claim remittance basis]
• Filing obligations: Self Assessment tax return
• [Other specific consequences based on facts]

[If non-UK resident]:
• Liable to UK tax only on UK source income
• UK residential property gains remain taxable
• [Check temporary non-residence rules if left UK recently]
• [Other specific consequences based on facts]

### Worked Example: June 2025 Question 1, Part 1 (Daniel Door)

**QUESTION FACTS** (from June 2025 exam):

*Daniel Door, a British citizen, has been UK resident for many years. On 1 April 2023, he moved to Spain with his Spanish partner Frederica. During the 2024/25 tax year:*

- *Spain: 95 days (at Spanish home) + 35 days (other) = 130 days total*
- *UK: 70 days + 28 days (hospital in February for medical treatment) = 98 days total*
- *Italy: 40 days*
- *Other countries: 97 days*
- *Daniel made a deliberate choice for family reasons to be treated in the UK for his medical emergency*
- *Frederica is UK resident (works >3 hours on 45 days in UK, spent 92 days in UK in 2022/23)*
- *Daniel has no minor children*
- *Daniel owns a UK home but did not stay there in 2024/25 (stayed in hotels when visiting UK)*
- *Daniel worked >3 hours in UK on only 5 occasions*
- *Daniel spent 92 days in UK in 2022/23*

**EXAMINER REQUIREMENT**: "Determine whether Daniel is UK resident for 2024/25."

**TIME ALLOCATION**: 25 minutes

**ANSWER** (using Template B):

---

**INDIVIDUAL RESIDENCE ANALYSIS - STATUTORY RESIDENCE TEST**

**Tax Year**: 2024/25  
**Individual**: Daniel Door

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**PRELIMINARY MATTERS**

**1. DAY COUNT**

Days in UK during 2024/25 tax year: **98 days**

Breakdown:
- Regular UK visits: 70 days
- Hospital stay (February 2025): 28 days
- **TOTAL**: 98 days

*Note on hospital days*: Daniel made a deliberate choice for family reasons to be treated in the UK. His hospital stay is therefore **unlikely to qualify for the exceptional circumstances exception**. These 28 days count toward his UK day total.

[Annotation: ✓ Examiners look for you to spot this - deliberate choice = days count. Worth 2 marks.]

**2. ARRIVER vs LEAVER STATUS**

Tax year 2021/22: UK resident (stated "always been UK resident" until 1 April 2023)  
Tax year 2022/23: UK resident  
Tax year 2023/24: Non-UK resident (moved to Spain 1 April 2023)

**Conclusion**: Daniel is a **LEAVER** for 2024/25

*Reasoning*: A "leaver" is an individual who was UK resident in 1 or more of the previous 3 tax years. Daniel was resident in 2021/22 and 2022/23, so meets this definition.

[Annotation: ✓ Critical determination - leavers face stricter day/tie thresholds. Worth 2-3 marks.]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**PART A: AUTOMATIC OVERSEAS TEST**

Under FA 2013 Sch 45 Part 2, Daniel is automatically NON-UK resident if ANY of the following tests are met:

**Test 1: Non-resident in all previous 3 years + <46 UK days**

Daniel **was resident** in 1 or more of the previous 3 years (2021/22 and 2022/23).

→ **Test 1: FAILED** - does not meet "non-resident in all previous 3 years" condition

[Annotation: ✓ Always state why test fails, not just conclusion. Worth 1 mark.]

---

**Test 2: Resident in 1+ previous 3 years + <16 UK days**

Daniel **was resident** in 1 or more of the previous 3 tax years (2021/22, 2022/23).  
Daniel spent **98 days** in UK, which **exceeds** 16 days.

→ **Test 2: FAILED** - 98 days > 16 day threshold

---

**Test 3: Full-time work abroad + <91 UK days + <31 UK work days**

Full-time work abroad requires average 35+ hours per week over the period.

Daniel's work pattern: The question states Daniel "does no work for more than half the year." This means Daniel cannot meet the full-time work abroad requirement.

→ **Test 3: FAILED** - Daniel does not work full-time abroad

[Annotation: ✓ Picking up this fact from the question shows careful reading. Worth 2 marks.]

---

**CONCLUSION ON AUTOMATIC OVERSEAS TEST:**

Daniel **FAILED** the Automatic Overseas Test (none of the 3 sub-tests passed).

→ **PROCEED TO AUTOMATIC UK RESIDENCE TEST**

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**PART B: AUTOMATIC UK RESIDENCE TEST**

Under FA 2013 Sch 45 Part 3, Daniel is automatically UK resident if ANY of the following tests are met:

**Test 1: 183+ days in UK**

Daniel spent **98 days** in UK in 2024/25.

98 < 183

→ **Test 1: FAILED** - below 183 day threshold

[Annotation: ✓ This is the most straightforward test. Worth 1-2 marks.]

---

**Test 2: Only home in UK**

"Home" test requirements:
- Individual has home in UK available for 91+ consecutive days
- Individual present in UK home on 30+ separate days in tax year
- Individual has NO overseas home OR overseas home <30 days present

Daniel's homes:
- **UK home**: Yes - Daniel owns a UK home (available all year = 365 days)
- **Present in UK home**: **0 days** - "does not spend any time in his UK home during 2024/25" (stayed in hotels)
- **Overseas homes**: Yes - Daniel has homes in Spain and several other countries

Analysis:

Even though Daniel has a UK home available for 91+ days, he was **not present in it for at least 30 days** in the tax year. The test requires BOTH conditions to be met.

Additionally, Daniel has overseas homes where he is present.

→ **Test 2: FAILED** - only home test not satisfied

[Annotation: ✓ Common trap - students forget the "present 30 days" requirement. Spotting this worth 2-3 marks.]

---

**Test 3: Full-time work in UK**

Full-time work in UK requires:
- Work in UK throughout 365-day period
- Average 35+ hours per week
- >75% of work days are UK work days
- At least 1 UK work day in tax year

Daniel's work pattern in UK:

Daniel "only works in the UK, for more than 3 hours on **5 occasions**."

5 occasions is far below the threshold for full-time work (which would require working substantially throughout the year with >75% of work days in UK).

→ **Test 3: FAILED** - Daniel does not work full-time in UK

---

**CONCLUSION ON AUTOMATIC UK RESIDENCE TEST:**

Daniel **FAILED** the Automatic UK Residence Test (none of the 3 sub-tests passed).

→ **PROCEED TO SUFFICIENT TIES TEST**

[Annotation: ✓ This is the typical pattern - most complex SRT questions land in Sufficient Ties Test. Worth noting you've systematically ruled out automatic tests. Worth 2 marks for clear structure.]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**PART C: SUFFICIENT TIES TEST**

Under FA 2013 Sch 45 Part 4, residence is determined by the number of "ties" to the UK combined with days spent in the UK.

**STEP 1: IDENTIFY TIES**

---

**TIE 1: FAMILY TIE**

Conditions:
- Spouse/civil partner is UK resident (under SRT), OR
- Minor children (<18 at start of tax year) are UK resident

Analysis of facts:

**Spouse/Partner**: Frederica (Daniel's Spanish partner)

Frederica's residence status for 2024/25:
- Days in UK 2024/25: 98 days (same as Daniel)
- Work in UK: >3 hours on **45 days** in 2024/25 → **Work tie exists**
- 90-day tie: Spent **92 days** in UK in 2022/23 → **90-day tie exists**
- Ties: 2 ties (work + 90-day)

Applying Sufficient Ties matrix for Frederica (she is also a leaver):
- 98 days in UK + 2 ties
- As a leaver with 91-120 days, she needs **2+ ties** for UK residence
- Frederica has exactly 2 ties
- **Frederica IS UK resident** for 2024/25

**Minor Children**: Daniel has **no minor children** (stated in facts).

→ **FAMILY TIE: EXISTS**

**Reasoning**: Frederica, Daniel's partner, is UK resident in her own right under the SRT (98 days + 2 ties). This creates a family tie for Daniel.

[Annotation: ✓✓ This is complex - you must work out Frederica's residence to determine Daniel's family tie. Shows high-level analysis. Worth 4-5 marks.]

---

**TIE 2: ACCOMMODATION TIE**

Conditions:
- UK accommodation available for 91+ consecutive days in tax year, AND
- Individual present in accommodation on 1+ nights in tax year
- (OR) Family/friend accommodation used 16+ nights

Analysis of facts:

**UK Property Owned/Rented**:
- Daniel owns a UK home
- Available for: 365 days continuously (all year)
- Individual present: **0 nights** - "does not spend any time in his UK home during 2024/25"

**Family/Friend Accommodation**:
- Daniel stays in **hotels** when he visits the UK
- No mention of stays at family/friend homes

→ **ACCOMMODATION TIE: DOES NOT EXIST**

**Reasoning**: Although Daniel has a UK home available for 91+ days, he did not spend **at least one night** in it during the tax year. The accommodation tie requires BOTH conditions. Hotel stays do not create an accommodation tie.

[Annotation: ✓ Another common trap - accommodation must be available AND used. Worth 2-3 marks.]

---

**TIE 3: WORK TIE**

Condition:
- Works in UK >3 hours on 40+ days in tax year

Analysis of facts:

Daniel "only worked in the UK for more than 3 hours on **5 occasions**."

5 days < 40 day threshold

→ **WORK TIE: DOES NOT EXIST**

**Reasoning**: Daniel worked >3 hours on only 5 days in UK, well below the 40-day threshold required.

[Annotation: ✓ Straightforward application. Worth 1-2 marks.]

---

**TIE 4: 90-DAY TIE**

Condition:
- Spent >90 days in UK in EITHER of the 2 preceding tax years

Analysis of facts:

Tax year 2022/23: **92 UK days** (stated in facts)  
Tax year 2023/24: Not stated, but Daniel moved to Spain 1 April 2023, so likely <90 days

At least ONE of the previous two years (2022/23) had **>90 days**.

→ **90-DAY TIE: EXISTS**

**Reasoning**: Daniel spent 92 days in UK in 2022/23, which exceeds 90 days. This is sufficient - only ONE of the previous two years needs to exceed 90 days.

[Annotation: ✓ Important - you don't need BOTH years >90 days, just one. Worth 2 marks.]

---

**TIE 5: COUNTRY TIE** (only applies to "leavers")

Condition:
- Spends more days in UK than in any other single country

Analysis of facts:

Days by country in 2024/25:
- **Spain**: 130 days (95 at Spanish home + 35 other)
- **UK**: 98 days
- **Italy**: 40 days
- **Other countries**: 97 days (but split across multiple countries)

Highest single country: **Spain with 130 days**  
UK days: **98 days**

Comparison: UK days (98) **LESS THAN** Spain days (130)

→ **COUNTRY TIE: DOES NOT EXIST**

**Reasoning**: Daniel spent more days in Spain (130) than in the UK (98) during 2024/25. The country tie only exists if UK days exceed ALL other countries. Spain is the single country with most days.

[Annotation: ✓ Critical calculation - must identify the highest OTHER country. Worth 2-3 marks.]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**STEP 2: COUNT TIES**

**TOTAL TIES FOR DANIEL**: **2 / 5**

Summary:
- ✓ **Family Tie**: **YES** (Frederica is UK resident)
- ✗ **Accommodation Tie**: **NO** (UK home not used)
- ✗ **Work Tie**: **NO** (only 5 UK work days)
- ✓ **90-Day Tie**: **YES** (92 days in 2022/23)
- ✗ **Country Tie**: **NO** (more days in Spain)

[Annotation: ✓ Clear summary helps examiner mark quickly. Worth 1 mark for presentation.]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**STEP 3: APPLY SUFFICIENT TIES MATRIX**

Daniel is a **LEAVER** (resident in 1+ of previous 3 years)  
Daniel spent **98 days** in UK  
Daniel has **2 ties** to UK

**Applicable Matrix for LEAVERS**:

| UK Days     | Ties Required | Daniel's Position        |
|-------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| < 16        | Any           | Automatic overseas       |
| 16 - 45     | 4+ ties       | -                        |
| 46 - 90     | 3+ ties       | -                        |
| **91 - 120**    | **2+ ties**       | **98 days, 2 ties ✓**   |
| 121 - 182   | 1+ tie        | -                        |
| 183+        | Any           | Automatic UK             |

**Application**:

Days in UK: **98** → Falls in bracket **[91-120]**  
Ties required for UK residence: **2+**  
Ties present: **2**

Comparison: **2 ties = 2 ties required**

Daniel has **exactly the number of ties required** for UK residence in the 91-120 day bracket.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**FINAL CONCLUSION**

Based on the Statutory Residence Test analysis:

**Daniel Door IS UK tax resident for tax year 2024/25.**

**Basis of determination**: Sufficient Ties Test

**Reasoning**: 

As a leaver who spent 98 days in the UK (falling in the 91-120 day bracket), Daniel requires 2 or more ties to be UK resident. Daniel has exactly 2 ties:
1. **Family tie** (partner Frederica is UK resident)
2. **90-day tie** (spent 92 days in UK in 2022/23)

Based on having 2 ties and 98 UK days, Daniel **exceeds the threshold** for UK residence under the Sufficient Ties Test and is therefore UK resident for 2024/25.

[Annotation: ✓✓ Clear, definitive conclusion citing the specific test and reasoning. Essential for full marks. Worth 3-4 marks.]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**MARK ALLOCATION** (Estimated based on June 2025 suggested solutions):

| Element | Marks |
|---------|-------|
| Day count (including hospital analysis) | 2-3 |
| Arriver/Leaver determination | 2 |
| Automatic Overseas Test (all 3 sub-tests) | 3-4 |
| Automatic UK Test (all 3 sub-tests) | 3-4 |
| Family tie (including Frederica's residence analysis) | 4-5 |
| Other ties analysis (4 ties) | 4-5 |
| Sufficient Ties matrix application | 2-3 |
| Final conclusion | 2-3 |
| **TOTAL** | **22-29/25** |

*Note: Total exceeds 25 because examiners use positive marking - you can score maximum marks even if you don't cover every single point.*

**Time Taken**: Approximately 25-28 minutes for this level of answer

---

**KEY LEARNING POINTS from this example**:

1. ✓ **Deliberate choice hospital days COUNT** - not exceptional circumstances
2. ✓ **Must determine spouse's residence first** before concluding on family tie
3. ✓ **Accommodation tie requires BOTH available AND used** - common trap
4. ✓ **90-day tie looks at EITHER of previous 2 years** - not both
5. ✓ **Country tie compares UK with HIGHEST single other country**
6. ✓ **Work systematically through ALL tests** - don't skip to Sufficient Ties
7. ✓ **Show your workings** - examiners award marks for method even if conclusion wrong

### Error Prevention: Top 10 Mistakes (SRT)

**MISTAKE #1**: "Counting hospital days as 'exceptional circumstances' when deliberate choice"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Hospital stay doesn't count because medical emergency"
- ✅ **Correct**: "Deliberate choice to come to UK for treatment = days count"
- **Test**: Was it a deliberate choice? If YES → days count
- **Prevention**: Read facts carefully - "elected," "chose," "decided" = deliberate

**MISTAKE #2**: "Skipping Automatic tests and jumping straight to Sufficient Ties"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Counting ties without checking 183-day test first
- ✅ **Correct**: ALWAYS apply tests in order: Automatic Overseas → Automatic UK → Sufficient Ties
- **Why critical**: You can miss easy conclusions (e.g., 183+ days = automatic UK resident)
- **Time saving**: Automatic tests take 3 minutes total, save 15 minutes if they apply

**MISTAKE #3**: "Forgetting to determine spouse's residence before concluding on family tie"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Spouse lives in UK → family tie exists"
- ✅ **Correct**: "Spouse is UK resident UNDER THE SRT → family tie exists"
- **Critical point**: Must analyze spouse's residence through SRT - living in UK ≠ UK resident
- **Common in exams**: June 2025 tested this - Frederica needed full SRT analysis

**MISTAKE #4**: "Counting accommodation tie when home not used"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Has UK home available → accommodation tie"
- ✅ **Correct**: "Has UK home available for 91+ days AND present 1+ nights → accommodation tie"
- **Both conditions required**: Available + Used
- **Classic trap**: Examiners love this - home available but individual stays in hotels

**MISTAKE #5**: "Confusing 90-day tie (needs ONE of previous 2 years >90)"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Spent 92 days in 2022/23 but only 50 days in 2023/24 → no 90-day tie"
- ✅ **Correct**: "Spent 92 days in 2022/23 → 90-day tie EXISTS (only need one year)"
- **Rule**: EITHER of the two preceding years >90 days is sufficient
- **Don't**: Add them together or require both years

**MISTAKE #6**: "Country tie calculation error - using total 'other' instead of single highest"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "UK 98 days, Other countries 167 days total → no country tie"
- ✅ **Correct**: "UK 98 days, Spain 130 days (highest single) → no country tie"
- **Key word**: "Single" country - compare UK with the ONE country with most days
- **Not**: Total of all other countries combined

**MISTAKE #7**: "Mixing up Arriver vs Leaver thresholds"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Applying arriver matrix when individual was resident last year
- ✅ **Correct**: Check residence history first → determine status → use correct matrix
- **Critical**: Leavers have STRICTER requirements (can be resident with fewer days)
- **Memorize**: Resident in 1+ of previous 3 years = Leaver

**MISTAKE #8**: "Not counting ALL relevant work days for work tie"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Works occasionally in UK → no work tie"
- ✅ **Correct**: Count every single day >3 hours, including travel days where work done
- **Threshold**: 40+ days (>3 hours each) = work tie
- **Include**: Employed work, self-employed, director duties, remote work while in UK

**MISTAKE #9**: "Concluding residence without stating which test applies"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Individual is UK resident." [Stop]
- ✅ **Correct**: "Individual is UK resident under the Sufficient Ties Test because..."
- **Examiner wants**: Explicit statement of which test led to conclusion
- **Marks**: Costs 2-3 marks if you don't specify the basis

**MISTAKE #10**: "Forgetting split year treatment in arrival/departure scenarios"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Analyzing full-year residence only when individual clearly arrived/left mid-year
- ✅ **Correct**: After determining year-residence, check if split year cases apply
- **Don't skip**: Even if question doesn't explicitly ask, flag split year possibility
- **Bonus marks**: Mentioning relevant split year case earns 2-3 professional marks

### Quick Reference: Key Legislation & Thresholds

**Primary Legislation** (memorize this):
- **FA 2013 Schedule 45**: Statutory Residence Test
  - Part 2: Automatic Overseas Test
  - Part 3: Automatic Resident Test  
  - Part 4: Sufficient Ties Test
  - Part 5: Split Year Treatment

---

**Day Counting Rules**:
- Count days present in UK **at midnight**
- EXCLUDE: Days in transit (< 4 hours), exceptional circumstances (very rare)
- INCLUDE: Arrival day (if present at midnight), departure day (if present at midnight)
- Hospital stays: Count UNLESS truly exceptional AND not deliberate choice

---

**Automatic Overseas Test** (if ANY passed → non-resident):
1. Non-resident all 3 prior years + **<46 days**
2. Resident 1+ prior years + **<16 days**
3. Full-time work abroad + **<91 days** + **<31 UK work days**

---

**Automatic UK Test** (if ANY passed → UK resident):
1. **≥183 days** in UK
2. Only home in UK (91+ days available, 30+ days present, no overseas home)
3. Full-time work in UK (365-day period, >75% UK work days)

---

**The Five Ties**:

| Tie | Condition | Key Facts Needed |
|-----|-----------|------------------|
| **Family** | Spouse/partner OR minor children UK resident | Spouse's days + ties; children's location |
| **Accommodation** | UK home 91+ days available AND 1+ night present | Property ownership; nights stayed |
| **Work** | Work >3 hours on **40+ days** in UK | Count every day >3 hours worked |
| **90-Day** | **>90 days** in UK in EITHER of 2 prior years | Prior year day counts |
| **Country** | More days in UK than any **single** other country | Day breakdown by country |

---

**Sufficient Ties Matrix - LEAVERS**:

| Days | 16-45 | 46-90 | 91-120 | 121-182 |
|------|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| Ties needed | 4+ | 3+ | **2+** | 1+ |

**Sufficient Ties Matrix - ARRIVERS**:

| Days | 46-90 | 91-120 | 121-182 |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| Ties needed | 4+ | 3+ | 2+ |

---

**Split Year Treatment - 8 Cases**:

**Leaving UK**:
- Case 1: Starting full-time work abroad
- Case 2: Partner starting full-time work abroad
- Case 3: Ceasing to have a home in UK

**Coming to UK**:
- Case 4: Starting to have a UK home only
- Case 5: Starting full-time work in UK
- Case 6: Ceasing full-time work abroad
- Case 7: Partner ceasing full-time work abroad
- Case 8: Starting to have a UK home

---

**Treaty Tie-Breaker (OECD Model Article 4(2))** - for individuals:

1. **Permanent home** → Where available?
2. **Centre of vital interests** (if homes in both) → Personal/economic ties closer where?
3. **Habitual abode** (if unclear) → Where habitually live?
4. **Nationality** → Which citizenship?

---

**Common Mark Allocation Patterns** (based on 2020-2025 exams):

- Day counting + exceptional circumstances: 2-3 marks
- Arriver/Leaver determination: 1-2 marks
- Automatic Overseas Test (all 3): 3-4 marks
- Automatic UK Test (all 3): 3-4 marks
- Five ties analysis: 6-8 marks (complex ties like family worth 3-4 marks each)
- Matrix application: 2-3 marks
- Conclusion: 2-3 marks
- Split year / treaty (if applicable): 3-5 marks

**Total for typical SRT question**: 20-25 marks

---

**Time Management Targets**:
- Day count + status determination: 3-5 minutes
- Automatic tests (both): 5-6 minutes
- Five ties analysis: 10-12 minutes
- Matrix application + conclusion: 3-4 minutes
- Split year / treaty (if needed): 5-8 minutes
- **TOTAL**: 26-35 minutes depending on complexity

---

**Pro Tips** for Exam Day:

1. ✓ Create a quick ties checklist on scrap paper at start (F/A/W/90/C)
2. ✓ Draw the day/tie matrix relevant to status (arriver/leaver) before analyzing
3. ✓ For complex spouse residence - do mini-SRT analysis in margin first
4. ✓ Always explicitly state which test led to your conclusion
5. ✓ If time running out - write conclusion even if analysis incomplete (3 marks)

*Continue to Section 2.1.3: Permanent Establishment →*



## 2.1.3 Permanent Establishment (PE)

### Pattern Recognition: Spotting This Question Type

**Immediate Triggers** (if you see these words, deploy this template):
- "Permanent Establishment," "PE," "fixed place of business"
- "Branch," "office," "factory," "warehouse," "place of management"
- "Agent," "authority to conclude contracts," "dependent agent"
- "Server," "website," "digital presence"
- "Preparatory or auxiliary," "delivery," "storage"
- "Attribution of profits to PE"
- Non-resident company with UK activities/presence

**Exam Frequency**: **63% (5/8 exams from 2020-2025)**

**Recent Exam Appearances**:
- **June 2025 Q2**: Solaris Future SA - UK office with employees doing market research
- December 2024: PE question
- June 2024: PE question
- **Pattern**: Frequently combined with corporate residence or transfer pricing issues

**Mark Range**: **10-18 marks** (often part of larger corporate tax question)

---

### Strategic Context

**Why This Matters:**

✓ PE determines whether non-UK company has **UK taxable presence**
✓ Without PE: foreign company pays NO UK corporation tax on foreign income
✓ With PE: profits **attributable to PE** are subject to UK CT (25%)
✓ PE + corporate residence risk = dual taxation danger
✓ Digital economy creates new PE risks (servers, websites, commissionaire structures)

**Common Exam Scenarios**:
1. Foreign company with UK office/employees
2. Agency PE (UK agent concluding contracts)
3. E-commerce (server location vs business location)
4. Construction/installation PE (time thresholds)
5. Preparatory/auxiliary activity exemption

**Time Allocation Strategy:**
- **Standalone PE analysis**: 15-18 minutes
- **Integrated with corporate residence**: Add 12-15 minutes
- **With profit attribution**: Add 8-10 minutes
- **Total for typical question**: 20-30 minutes

**Difficulty vs. Return Assessment:**
- **Difficulty**: Medium (requires understanding of both domestic law and treaty)
- **Return**: High (methodical application earns 12-16 marks easily)
- **Efficiency Gain**: Template approach saves 6-8 minutes vs unstructured answer

**TEMPLATE C: Permanent Establishment Analysis**

```
PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT ANALYSIS: [Company Name]

Country of Residence: [Country]
Activity in UK: [Brief description]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PART 1: UK DOMESTIC LAW - FIXED PLACE PE (s1141 CTA 2010)

Under s1141 CTA 2010, a non-UK resident company has a UK Permanent
Establishment if it has a fixed place of business in the UK through 
which the business of the company is wholly or partly carried on.

Test 1: Fixed Place of Business in UK?

A "fixed place" includes:
✓ Place of management, branch, office
✓ Factory, workshop, mine, oil/gas well
✓ Building site, construction/installation project

Facts:
[Company name] has [describe physical presence - office/employees/etc.]
located at [location/address if given] in the UK.

→ Fixed place requirement: [MET / NOT MET]

Reasoning: [Explain based on facts]

---

Test 2: Business Carried On Through That Place?

The business must be carried on "through" the fixed place, meaning:
• The fixed place is more than incidental to the business
• Activities of the business are performed at/from that location
• NOT just passive holding of assets

Facts:
[Describe activities performed at UK location]:
• [Activity 1 - e.g., "Market research by 3 full-time employees"]
• [Activity 2 - e.g., "Customer liaison and relationship management"]
• [Activity 3]

Analysis:
[Are these activities part of carrying on the business? Or just 
preparatory/auxiliary?]

→ Business carried on requirement: [MET / NOT MET]

Reasoning: [Explain based on facts]

---

CONCLUSION ON FIXED PLACE PE (Domestic Law):

[Company name] [DOES / DOES NOT] have a fixed place PE in the UK 
under s1141 CTA 2010.

[If YES]: The UK [office/branch] constitutes a fixed place through 
which [Company]'s business is carried on.

[If NO]: [Explain why not - e.g., no fixed place, or business not 
carried on through it]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PART 2: UK DOMESTIC LAW - AGENCY PE (s1142 CTA 2010)

[Only complete if relevant - i.e., if there's an agent/intermediary in UK]

Under s1142 CTA 2010, a non-UK resident company has a UK PE if an 
agent acting on behalf of the company in the UK has, and habitually 
exercises, authority to do business on behalf of the company.

Test 1: Agent in UK?

Facts:
[Is there an individual/company acting as agent in UK?]
[Agent name/description]: _______________________________

→ Agent exists: [YES / NO]

---

Test 2: Authority to Conclude Contracts?

The agent must have authority to conclude contracts that are:
• In the name of the company, OR
• For the transfer of property owned by the company, OR
• For the provision of services by the company

Facts:
[Does the agent have authority to conclude contracts?]
[Describe scope of authority]: _______________________________

→ Authority to conclude contracts: [YES / NO]

---

Test 3: Habitually Exercises Authority?

"Habitually" means regularly, as part of normal business operations.

Facts:
[How often does agent exercise authority? Regular pattern?]

→ Habitually exercises: [YES / NO]

---

Test 4: Independent Agent Exception (s1142(2))

An independent agent does NOT create a PE if:
• Agent acts in ordinary course of business as independent agent
• Examples: broker, general commission agent
• NOT independent if: works exclusively/primarily for company

Facts:
[Is agent independent? Or dependent on company?]

→ Independent agent exception: [APPLIES / DOES NOT APPLY]

---

CONCLUSION ON AGENCY PE (Domestic Law):

[Company name] [DOES / DOES NOT] have an agency PE in the UK 
under s1142 CTA 2010.

Reasoning: [Explain]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PART 3: PREPARATORY OR AUXILIARY ACTIVITIES EXEMPTION (s1143)

**CRITICAL EXEMPTION** - Even if fixed place PE exists, s1143 CTA 2010 
provides that a company does NOT have PE if activities are of a 
"preparatory or auxiliary character."

Specific exempt activities listed in s1143:
✓ Use of facilities solely for storage, display, or delivery of goods
✓ Maintenance of stock solely for storage, display, or delivery
✓ Maintenance of stock solely for processing by another enterprise
✓ Maintenance of fixed place solely for purchasing goods/collecting 
  information for the company
✓ Maintenance of fixed place solely for carrying on any other activity 
  of preparatory or auxiliary character

Analysis of UK Activities:

Activities performed at UK location:
[List each activity identified in Part 1]

Activity 1: [Description]
→ Assessment: [Core business activity / Preparatory or auxiliary?]
→ Reasoning: [Explain - does this generate revenue? Essential to 
   business model? Or just supporting/preparatory?]

Activity 2: [Description]
→ Assessment: [Core business activity / Preparatory or auxiliary?]

[Continue for each activity]

---

**KEY PRINCIPLE** (Case law + HMRC guidance):

"Preparatory or auxiliary" means:
❌ NOT the essential and significant part of the business
❌ NOT revenue-generating activities
❌ NOT activities without which the business could not function

✓ Supporting, preliminary, or facilitating activities
✓ Activities that, if withdrawn, would not stop business operating

---

CONCLUSION ON PREPARATORY/AUXILIARY EXEMPTION:

The activities performed at the UK [office/location] [ARE / ARE NOT] 
of a preparatory or auxiliary character.

[If auxiliary]: Under s1143 CTA 2010, these activities fall within the 
preparatory or auxiliary exemption. Therefore, [Company] does NOT have 
a UK PE despite having a fixed place of business.

[If NOT auxiliary]: These are core business activities that generate 
value/revenue for [Company]. The s1143 exemption does NOT apply.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PART 4: TREATY CONSIDERATIONS (If Applicable)

[Only complete if there is a DTA between UK and company's country]

DTA: UK-[Country] Double Taxation Agreement

Under CTA 2009 s18, where a DTA exists, the treaty definition of PE 
overrides UK domestic law.

OECD Model Article 5 PE Definition (most UK DTAs follow this):

Article 5(1): Fixed place of business through which business is carried on
Article 5(2): Specifically includes - place of management, branch, office,
              factory, workshop, mine, construction site (>12 months)
Article 5(3): Building site/construction PE only if >12 months
Article 5(4): Exemptions for preparatory/auxiliary activities
Article 5(5): Dependent agent PE
Article 5(6): Independent agent exception

Comparison: UK Law vs Treaty:

| Element | UK Domestic Law | Treaty (Art 5) | Which Applies? |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Fixed place test | s1141 CTA 2010 | Art 5(1) | [Same / Treaty narrower] |
| Exemptions | s1143 | Art 5(4) | [Same / Treaty narrower] |
| Agent PE | s1142 | Art 5(5)-(6) | [Same / Treaty narrower] |

Conclusion on Treaty PE:

Under the UK-[Country] DTA Article 5, [Company] [DOES / DOES NOT] have
a treaty PE in the UK.

[If different from domestic law]: Although [Company] [has/does not have]
a PE under UK domestic law, the treaty definition [narrows/broadens] the
PE threshold, resulting in [different conclusion].

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FINAL CONCLUSION

Based on the above analysis:

[Company Name] [DOES / DOES NOT] have a Permanent Establishment in the 
United Kingdom for tax purposes.

Basis of determination:
[UK domestic law (s1141/s1142/s1143) / Treaty Article 5]

Key reasoning:
[2-3 sentences summarizing why PE does/doesn't exist]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TAX CONSEQUENCES

[If PE EXISTS]:

1. **UK Corporation Tax Liability**
   • [Company] must register for UK Corporation Tax
   • UK CT applies to profits "attributable" to the PE (not all profits)
   • Attribution follows OECD Authorized OECD Approach (Article 7)
   • Current UK CT rate: 25% (or 19% if profits <£50,000)

2. **Transfer Pricing**
   • Transactions between head office and PE must be at arm's length
   • OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines apply
   • Documentation requirements

3. **Filing Obligations**
   • Annual CT600 corporation tax return
   • PE must prepare UK GAAP/IFRS accounts showing PE profits
   • Deadlines: 12 months after year-end (file); 9 months (payment)

4. **Profit Attribution Method**
   • OECD Authorized OECD Approach (per Article 7 OECD Model)
   • PE treated as "functionally separate enterprise"
   • Allocate assets, functions, risks to PE
   • Transfer pricing for internal dealings

[If PE DOES NOT EXIST]:

1. **No UK Corporation Tax Liability**
   • [Company] has no UK taxable presence
   • UK sales to customers do not create UK tax liability
   • [Company] remains solely liable to [home country] tax

2. **No UK Filing Obligations**
   • No CT600 required
   • No UK tax registration needed

3. **Caveat - Other UK Taxes May Apply**
   • Withholding taxes on UK-source income (if any)
   • VAT on UK sales (if exceed threshold)
   • Employment taxes (PAYE/NIC) for UK employees

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

RECOMMENDATIONS

[If PE exists or risk of PE]:

⚠️ **Risk Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Restructure UK Activities**
   • Limit UK office to genuine preparatory/auxiliary activities only
   • Examples: information gathering, market research (non-binding)
   • Ensure no contract conclusion authority in UK

2. **Substance Planning**
   • If PE is unavoidable, ensure UK PE has adequate substance
   • Properly document profit attribution methodology
   • Prepare transfer pricing documentation for head office transactions

3. **Consider UK Subsidiary**
   • Alternative: operate via UK-incorporated subsidiary instead of PE
   • Advantage: Greater clarity, separate legal entity
   • Disadvantage: UK CT on all subsidiary profits, not just PE portion

4. **Monitor E-Commerce PE Risk**
   • Servers located in UK may create PE (case-by-case)
   • Website alone generally NOT a PE (no personnel)
   • HMRC guidance: server + website not PE if passive

[If no PE - maintain status]:

✓ **Maintain Non-PE Status**:
• Continue ensuring UK activities remain preparatory/auxiliary
• Do not allow UK personnel to conclude contracts
• Regular review of UK activities to ensure no drift into core business
• Document business model clearly

*Continue to worked example from June 2025 Q2...*


### Worked Example: June 2025 Question 2, Option 1 (Extract)

**QUESTION FACTS** (Simplified from June 2025):

*Solaris Future SA, incorporated and tax resident in Spain, manufactures solar panels. Under Option 1, the company is considering:*
- *Renting an office in London*
- *Employing 3 full-time UK-based employees*
- *UK employees will conduct "market research and customer liaison"*
- *No mention of contract conclusion authority*
- *Sales delivered directly from Spain to UK customers*

**EXAMINER REQUIREMENT**: "UK Corporation Tax implications of Option 1."

**TIME ALLOCATION**: 15 minutes for PE analysis portion

---

**ANSWER** (using Template C - Extract):

**PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT ANALYSIS: Solaris Future SA (Option 1)**

Country of Residence: Spain  
Activity in UK: London office with 3 full-time employees for market research and customer liaison

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**PART 1: UK DOMESTIC LAW - FIXED PLACE PE (s1141 CTA 2010)**

Under s1141 CTA 2010, Solaris Future SA will have a UK Permanent Establishment if it has a fixed place of business in the UK through which its business is wholly or partly carried on.

**Test 1: Fixed Place of Business in UK?**

Facts:
Solaris Future SA will **rent an office in London** with 3 full-time UK-based employees conducting market research and customer liaison activities.

→ **Fixed place requirement: MET**

Reasoning: An office constitutes a "fixed place of business" under s1141 CTA 2010. The office is physically located in London and available to Solaris Future SA for its business activities.

[Annotation: ✓ Straightforward application - office = fixed place. Worth 1-2 marks.]

---

**Test 2: Business Carried On Through That Place?**

Facts:
Activities performed at UK office:
• Market research (by 3 full-time employees)
• Customer liaison (ongoing relationship management)

Analysis:
These employees are actively working for Solaris Future SA, conducting market research and liaising with UK customers. This constitutes "carrying on business" through the office, not merely passive use of the premises.

→ **Business carried on requirement: MET**

[Annotation: ✓ Key point - active business activities being performed. Worth 2 marks.]

---

**CONCLUSION ON FIXED PLACE PE (Domestic Law):**

Solaris Future SA **DOES have a fixed place PE** in the UK under s1141 CTA 2010.

The London office with 3 employees conducting market research and customer liaison constitutes a fixed place of business through which Solaris Future SA carries on its business.

[Annotation: ✓ Clear conclusion. Worth 1 mark.]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**PART 3: PREPARATORY OR AUXILIARY ACTIVITIES EXEMPTION (s1143)**

Even though a fixed place PE exists, s1143 CTA 2010 provides that NO PE exists if activities are of "preparatory or auxiliary character."

**Analysis of UK Activities:**

**Activity: Market Research and Customer Liaison**

The UK employees will conduct market research and customer liaison. The question states these activities include "collecting information" for Solaris Future SA.

s1143 CTA 2010 specifically lists "collecting information for the company" as an example of potentially preparatory or auxiliary activities.

**However, the critical question is**: Are these activities **solely** preparatory/auxiliary, or do they form an essential part of Sol aris Future SA's business?

**Assessment: Likely NOT preparatory or auxiliary**

Reasoning:
• Market research and customer liaison for a **3-person full-time UK office** suggests substantive business activities
• These employees are establishing relationships with UK customers and gathering intelligence to support UK sales
• This goes beyond passive "information collection" - it facilitates and enables UK sales
• **Not merely preparatory** - these are core sales support functions

The s1143 exemption applies where activities are "of a preparatory or auxiliary character." Case law and HMRC guidance emphasize this exemption is **narrow**. Activities that directly support revenue generation (like customer liaison for sales) typically do NOT qualify.

[Annotation: ✓✓ This is the critical analysis examiners look for - don't just list exemptions, apply them. Worth 4-5 marks.]

**CONCLUSION ON PREPARATORY/AUXILIARY EXEMPTION:**

The market research and customer liaison activities performed by the UK employees **are NOT of a preparatory or auxiliary character**.

These are substantive business activities that directly support Solaris Future SA's UK sales. The s1143 exemption **does NOT apply**.

[Annotation: ✓ This is the suggested answer's conclusion - UK activities too substantive. Worth 2-3 marks.]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**FINAL CONCLUSION**

**Solaris Future SA WILL HAVE a Permanent Establishment in the United Kingdom under Option 1.**

Basis: UK domestic law (s1141 CTA 2010)

Key reasoning:
• Fixed place of business (London office) exists ✓
• Business carried on through office (3 full-time employees) ✓
• Activities NOT preparatory or auxiliary (substantive sales support) ✓

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**TAX CONSEQUENCES**

**1. UK Corporation Tax Registration Required**

Solaris Future SA will need to:
• Register for UK Corporation Tax
• Submit annual CT600 returns
• Pay UK CT on profits **attributable to the PE**

**2. Profit Attribution**

Only profits **attributable** to the UK PE are subject to UK tax, not Solaris Future SA's worldwide profits.

Attribution must follow the **OECD Authorized OECD Approach** (per Article 7 of the OECD Model DTA and UK domestic law).

This approach treats the PE as a "functionally separate enterprise" and allocates profits based on:
• Functions performed by PE
• Assets used by PE
• Risks assumed by PE

Broadly, this follows **transfer pricing principles**.

[Annotation: ✓ Showing understanding of attribution methodology. Worth 3-4 marks.]

**3. Current UK Corporate Tax Rate**

Profits attributable to the PE will be subject to UK CT at:
• **25%** (main rate) if PE profits exceed £250,000
• **19%** (small profits rate) if PE profits ≤£50,000
• Marginal relief between £50,000-£250,000

**MARK ALLOCATION** (Estimated):

| Element | Marks |
|---------|-------|
| s1141 citation and fixed place test | 1-2 |
| Application: office = fixed place | 1-2 |
| Business carried on test application | 2 |
| s1143 preparatory/auxiliary analysis | 4-5 |
| Conclusion on PE status | 2 |
| Tax consequences (registration, attribution, rate) | 3-4 |
| **TOTAL (PE portion)** | **13-17/25** |

*Note: Question 2 also covered other issues (corporate residence risk, unallowable purpose, dividends) worth additional marks.*

**Time Taken**: Approximately 12-15 minutes for PE analysis

### Error Prevention: Top 10 Mistakes (PE)

**MISTAKE #1**: "Confusing 'fixed place' with 'permanent establishment'"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Has office = has PE" (forgetting preparatory/auxiliary exception)
- ✅ **Correct**: "Has fixed place → check if business carried on → check if preparatory/auxiliary"
- **Critical**: s1143 can negate PE even if s1141 criteria met

**MISTAKE #2**: "Applying preparatory/auxiliary exemption too broadly"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Market research is just information gathering → preparatory"
- ✅ **Correct**: "Market research by 3 full-time staff supporting sales → NOT preparatory"
- **Key**: Exemption is NARROW - only truly ancillary activities qualify

**MISTAKE #3**: "Forgetting treaty override of domestic law"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Only analyzing s1141 when UK-Spain DTA exists
- ✅ **Correct**: "Under s1141 PE exists, BUT Article 5 of UK-Spain DTA may provide different threshold"
- **Remember**: CTA 2009 s18 - treaties override domestic law

**MISTAKE #4**: "Confusing 'independent agent' with 'employee'"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Company's own employees could be independent agents"
- ✅ **Correct**: "Employees create PE risk; independent agents (brokers) don't"
- **Rule**: Own employees = agency PE risk; independent agents = exempt

**MISTAKE #5**: "Assuming all 'information collection' is preparatory"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "s1143 lists 'collecting information' → automatic exemption"
- ✅ **Correct**: "s1143 requires 'solely' for collection - if combined with sales support, NO exemption"
- **Watch**: "Solely" is key word in s1143

**MISTAKE #6**: "Not distinguishing server location from business location"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Server in UK = PE"
- ✅ **Correct**: "Server alone typically NOT PE (HMRC guidance) - need personnel using it"
- **Digital economy**: Website/server ≠ automatic PE

**MISTAKE #7**: "Forgetting profit attribution is NOT all profits"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Has UK PE → all company profits subject to UK CT"
- ✅ **Correct**: "Only profits ATTRIBUTABLE to PE subject to UK CT (Article 7 / OECD AOA)"
- **Impact**: Huge difference in tax liability

**MISTAKE #8**: "Ignoring corporate residence risk when discussing PE"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Analyzing PE only, missing that UK board meetings create CMC risk
- ✅ **Correct**: "Option 1 creates PE. ALSO warn: if board meets in UK → CMC risk → full UK residence"
- **Professional marks**: Spotting related risks (June 2025 Q2 tested this!)

**MISTAKE #9**: "Not citing specific legislation"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Company will have a PE in UK"
- ✅ **Correct**: "Under s1141 CTA 2010, company will have a PE..."
- **Marks**: Specific citation worth 1-2 marks every time

**MISTAKE #10**: "Recommending restructuring without being asked"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Spending 5 minutes on restructuring advice when question just asks "implications"
- ✅ **Correct**: State implications concisely; brief recommendations only if time permits
- **Time management**: Answer the question asked

---

### Quick Reference: PE Key Points

**UK Domestic Law Statutes**:
- **s1141 CTA 2010**: Fixed place of business PE
- **s1142 CTA 2010**: Agency PE (dependent agent)
- **s1143 CTA 2010**: Preparatory or auxiliary exemption
- **s1144 CTA 2010**: Independent agent (no PE)
- **CTA 2009 s18**: Treaties override domestic law

**Fixed Place PE Elements** (s1141):
1. Fixed place of business (office, branch, factory, mine, building site)
2. In the UK
3. Through which business is wholly or partly carried on

**Agency PE Elements** (s1142):
1. Agent acting in UK
2. Has authority to conclude contracts
3. Habitually exercises that authority
4. NOT independent agent (brokers, commission agents)

**Preparatory or Auxiliary Exemption** (s1143):
✓ Storage, display, delivery of goods
✓ Purchasing goods or collecting information
✓ Other activities of preparatory or auxiliary character
❌ **NOT exempt**: Core revenue-generating activities

**OECD Model Article 5** (Treaty PE):
- Art 5(1): Fixed place definition
- Art 5(2): Specific examples (management, branch, office, factory, workshop, mine)
- Art 5(3): Building site/construction >12 months
- Art 5(4): Preparatory/auxiliary exemptions
- Art 5(5): Dependent agent PE
- Art 5(6): Independent agent exception

**Common PE Scenarios**:

| Situation | PE Risk? | Why? |
|-----------|----------|------|
| UK office + employees doing sales | **HIGH** | Fixed place + core business |
| UK warehouse (storage only) | Low | Preparatory/auxiliary (s1143) |
| UK agent concluding contracts | **HIGH** | Agency PE (s1142) |
| Server in UK (no personnel) | Low | HMRC: server alone not PE |
| Construction site <12 months | Medium | Domestic law PE, treaty may exempt |
| Independent broker in UK | Low | Independent agent exception |

**Profit Attribution** (if PE exists):
- OECD Authorized OECD Approach (Article 7)
- PE treated as functionally separate enterprise
- Allocate assets, functions, risks to PE
- Apply transfer pricing to internal dealings
- Only profits attributable to PE taxed in UK

**Time Management Targets**:
- Fixed place test: 3-4 minutes
- Preparatory/auxiliary analysis: 5-6 minutes
- Agency PE (if relevant): 3-4 minutes
- Treaty considerations: 3-4 minutes
- Consequences: 2-3 minutes
- **TOTAL**: 16-21 minutes

**Mark Allocation Patterns**:
- Legislation citations (s1141/s1142/s1143): 2-3 marks
- Fixed place test application: 2-3 marks
- Preparatory/auxiliary analysis: 4-6 marks
- Agency PE (if applicable): 3-4 marks
- Treaty override: 2-3 marks
- Profit attribution: 2-3 marks
- Consequences/recommendations: 2-3 marks
- **TOTAL**: 17-25 marks (depending on question complexity)

*This completes Section 2.1.3: Permanent Establishment*

**Progress Update**:
- ✅ 2.1.1 Corporate Residence & Treaty Tie-Breaker
- ✅ 2.1.2 Individual Residence - Statutory Residence Test  
- ✅ 2.1.3 Permanent Establishment

**Remaining for Part A**:
- 2.1.4 Remittance Basis (75% frequency - CRITICAL)
- 2.1.5 Double Tax Relief & Temporary Non-Residence

---

## 2.1.4 Remittance Basis

### Pattern Recognition: Spotting This Question Type

**Immediate Triggers** (if you see these words, deploy this template):
- "Non-domiciled," "non-dom," "remittance basis," "arising basis"
- "Foreign income," "foreign gains," "offshore income"
- "Remittance Basis Charge (RBC)," "£30,000 charge," "£60,000 charge"
- "Remitted to UK," "brought to UK," "used in UK"
- "Mixed funds," "clean capital," "tainted income"
- "Business Investment Relief (BIR)"
- "Offshore insurance bond," "wrapper," "protected settlement"

**Exam Frequency**: **75% (6/8 exams from 2020-2025)** - CRITICAL

**Recent Exam Appearances**:
- **June 2025 Q3** (Part B): Freja Hansen - Offshore insurance bonds, remittance basis, PPB anti-avoidance (20 marks)
- December 2024: Remittance basis question
- June 2024: Remittance basis question
- **Pattern**: Appears regularly in **Part B (20 marks)** or occasionally Part C (15 marks), NOT typically in Part A

**Mark Range**: **15-20 marks** (usually Part B question)

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: While Remittance Basis appears frequently (75%), it typically appears in **Part B or Part C**, not Part A. However, it may be **integrated** into Part A questions involving residence (e.g., non-dom returning to UK, TNR implications). You must understand it thoroughly for Parts B and C.

---

### Strategic Context

**Why This Matters:**

✓ Tested in **75% of exams** - you're very likely to see this
✓ Relatively straightforward marks if you know the rules
✓ Common integration with: deemed domicile, protected settlements, offshore structures
✓ Examiner reports show candidates lose marks through:
  - Confusing remittance basis eligibility with claims
  - Not understanding what constitutes a "remittance"
  - Missing the Remittance Basis Charge (RBC) calculation
  - Ignoring anti-avoidance provisions (PPB, Transfer of Assets Abroad)

**Time Allocation Strategy:**
- **Standalone remittance basis question (Part B)**: 35-40 minutes
- **Part C remittance basis question**: 25-28 minutes
- **Integrated into Part A (with residence/TNR)**: 8-12 minutes for remittance portion

**Difficulty vs. Return Assessment:**
- **Difficulty**: Medium (rules are formula-driven, but anti-avoidance can be complex)
- **Return**: High (structured answers earn marks easily)
- **Efficiency Gain**: Template approach = 12-16 marks in 25 minutes

---

### The Remittance Basis: Core Framework

**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING**: The UK taxes on two bases:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ARISING BASIS (Default for UK domiciled/deemed domiciled)  │
│  • Tax on worldwide income and gains AS THEY ARISE          │
│  • Regardless of whether brought to UK                      │
│  • Personal allowances available                            │
│  • Annual CGT exemption available (£3,000 in 2024/25)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  REMITTANCE BASIS (Available for non-UK domiciled)          │
│  • Tax ONLY on foreign income/gains REMITTED to UK          │
│  • Foreign income/gains kept offshore = NO UK tax           │
│  • Must CLAIM if resident 7+ years (lose allowances)        │
│  • May pay Remittance Basis Charge (RBC)                    │
│  • Loss of personal allowance and CGT exemption             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Legislation**:
- **ITA 2007 ss.809A-809Z**: Remittance basis provisions
- **TCGA 1992 s.12**: Remittance basis for capital gains
- **ITA 2007 s.809H**: Remittance Basis Charge
- **ITTOIA 2005 ss.515-526**: Personal Portfolio Bonds (PPB) anti-avoidance

---

### Execution Framework

**Step-by-Step Process** (Total Time: 25-30 minutes for Part B question)

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STEP 1: Determine Eligibility (3 min)                        │
│ • Is individual UK resident?                                  │
│ • Is individual non-UK domiciled (or not deemed domiciled)?  │
│ • If YES to both → eligible for remittance basis             │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STEP 2: Automatic vs Claim Basis (4 min)                     │
│ AUTOMATIC (no claim needed):                                  │

### Template & Tools

**TEMPLATE D: Remittance Basis Analysis**

```
REMITTANCE BASIS ANALYSIS: [Name]
Tax Year: 202X/2X

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. ELIGIBILITY FOR REMITTANCE BASIS

Under ITA 2007 s.809A, the remittance basis is available to an individual
who is:
(a) UK resident for the tax year, AND
(b) Not UK domiciled (or not deemed UK domiciled)

[Name]'s status:
• UK residence: [State - YES/NO based on SRT or facts given]
• UK domicile: [State - domicile of origin/choice/deemed]

→ Conclusion: [Name] [IS / IS NOT] eligible for remittance basis

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

2. AUTOMATIC vs CLAIM BASIS

The remittance basis applies AUTOMATICALLY (no claim needed) if:
(a) Unremitted foreign income and gains < £2,000 in the tax year, OR
(b) No UK-source income or gains (i.e. only foreign income/gains), OR
(c) UK resident for fewer than 7 out of the last 9 tax years

[Name]'s circumstances:
• Foreign income/gains: [Amount]
• Remitted to UK: [Amount]
• UK source income/gains: [YES/NO - amount if yes]
• Years UK resident: [X out of last Y years]

→ Automatic basis: [APPLIES / DOES NOT APPLY]

[If automatic does NOT apply]:

[Name] must CLAIM the remittance basis in their Self Assessment tax return.

Consequences of claiming:
❌ Loss of personal allowance (£12,570 in 2024/25)
❌ Loss of CGT annual exempt amount (£3,000 in 2024/25)
✓ Pay UK tax ONLY on foreign income/gains remitted to UK
✓ Offshore income/gains kept outside UK are NOT taxed

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

3. REMITTANCE BASIS CHARGE (RBC)

Under ITA 2007 s.809H, an individual who claims the remittance basis AND
has been UK resident for 7 or more years must pay a Remittance Basis Charge:

• UK resident 7-11 years (of last 14 years): £30,000
• UK resident 12+ years (of last 14 years): £60,000

[Name]'s position:
• UK resident for [X] years out of last [Y] years
• RBC applicable: [YES/NO]
• RBC amount: [£30,000 / £60,000 / Nil]

The RBC is paid IN ADDITION to any UK tax on amounts actually remitted.

The RBC "buys" the right to keep offshore income and gains outside the
UK tax charge.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

4. WHAT CONSTITUTES A REMITTANCE?

Under ITA 2007 s.809L, a remittance occurs when foreign income or gains are:
(a) Brought to, or received in, the UK
(b) Used in the UK
(c) Enjoyed in the UK by a "relevant person"

"Relevant person" includes:
• The individual
• Their spouse or civil partner
• Their minor (unmarried) children

Common remittances:
✓ Transfer from offshore account to UK bank account
✓ Using offshore funds to buy UK property/assets
✓ Using offshore credit card in UK (if paid from offshore funds)
✓ Gift to UK resident spouse (even if spouse doesn't bring to UK)
✓ Offshore funds used to settle UK debts

NOT remittances:
✗ Keeping funds in offshore account
✗ Spending funds while physically outside UK
✗ Gifts to adult (non-minor) children
✗ Clean capital (not derived from income/gains)

Application to [Name]:

[Describe the facts - what has been brought to/used in UK]:
_______________________________________________________________

Analysis:
[For each transaction, state whether it constitutes a remittance]
_______________________________________________________________

→ Remittances identified: [Amount]
→ UK tax due: [Calculate at appropriate rate]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

5. MIXED FUNDS (if applicable)

Under ITA 2007 s.809Q, where an offshore account contains a mixture of:
• Income (from various years)
• Capital gains
• Clean capital (original capital, no income/gains)

Any withdrawal is treated as coming from these sources in the following
ORDER:
1. Income (oldest first)
2. Capital gains (oldest first)
3. Clean capital

This means income is ALWAYS remitted first → taxed at highest rates.

[Name]'s situation:
[Describe the account composition if facts given]
_______________________________________________________________

PRACTICAL ADVICE: Keep separate accounts:
• Account 1: Clean capital only
• Account 2: Foreign income
• Account 3: Foreign capital gains

This allows selective remittances from clean capital account with no UK tax.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

6. BUSINESS INVESTMENT RELIEF (BIR)

Under ITA 2007 ss.809VA-809VO, an individual can bring foreign income/
gains to the UK WITHOUT a tax charge if:

• The funds are invested in a qualifying UK trading company
• Within 45 days of bringing to UK
• Investment is in shares or loans
• Company must be carrying on genuine UK trading activity
• NOT investment/property holding companies

Qualifying investment includes:
✓ Subscription for shares in UK trading company
✓ Loans to UK trading company
✓ Shares in company with genuine UK trade (>80% of activity)

[If applicable to question]:
[Describe whether the proposed investment qualifies for BIR]
_______________________________________________________________

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

7. ANTI-AVOIDANCE: TRANSFER OF ASSETS ABROAD (TOAA)

Under ITA 2007 ss.714-751, if an individual transfers assets to an offshore
structure AND income arises in that structure, the income may be taxed on
the UK resident transferor on an arising basis (not remittance basis).

TOAA applies UNLESS:
• There is no tax avoidance purpose (motive defense - s.741), OR
• The transfer was a genuine commercial transaction

Common scenarios where TOAA attacks remittance basis planning:
❌ Offshore trust funded by UK resident non-dom
❌ Offshore company owned by UK resident non-dom
❌ Offshore insurance bond with control over investments

[If question involves offshore structures]:
TOAA risk: [HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW]
Reasoning: ___________________________________________________

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

8. ANTI-AVOIDANCE: PERSONAL PORTFOLIO BONDS (PPB)

Under ITTOIA 2005 ss.515-526, offshore insurance bonds are NORMALLY
tax-deferred - income/gains accrue tax-free inside bond, tax only on
encashment (chargeable event).

HOWEVER, if the bond is a "Personal Portfolio Bond" (PPB), then:
• Annual income tax charge on bond gains (not deferred)
• Individual is taxed on arising basis annually
• Loses benefit of remittance basis

A bond is a PPB if:
• The bondholder (or related person) can SELECT the investments
• This includes indirect control via restrictive investment mandates

Avoiding PPB status:
✓ Use discretionary investment manager
✓ Do NOT retain power of selection
✓ Do NOT give restrictive investment guidelines
✓ Bond should hold only "publicly available" investments

[If question involves offshore insurance bonds/wrappers]:

PPB risk for [Name]: [HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW]

Reasoning:
• Selection power: [Describe facts - does individual control investments?]
• Type of assets: [Standard publicly traded / Bespoke assets?]
• Investment manager: [Discretionary / Non-discretionary?]

Recommendations to avoid PPB:
[List specific actions]

Reference case: IRC v Willoughby [1995] - bonds held as normal investment
should not trigger TOAA if no avoidance motive.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CONCLUSION

[Summarize key points]:

1. [Name] [is/is not] eligible for remittance basis
2. [Automatic / Must claim] - [with/without] RBC of [amount]
3. Remittances identified: [amount] → UK tax: [amount]
4. Anti-avoidance risks: [TOAA / PPB / None]
5. Recommendations: [Key 2-3 action points]

### Worked Example: June 2025 Question 3 (Part B - Extract)

**QUESTION FACTS** (Simplified from June 2025 Part B Q3):

*Freja Hansen is a UK resident, non-domiciled taxpayer who has always claimed the remittance basis. She holds two investment portfolios (foreign shares and private equity) plus shares in a family company. She wants to transfer these into an offshore insurance bond "wrapper." She is a hands-on investor who personally selects each stock. In five years, she will need to bring 20% of the initial premium to the UK.*

**EXAMINER REQUIREMENT**:
1) Explain main tax features of offshore insurance bonds and tax consequences of remittances (8 marks)
2) Which investments can be held tax efficiently in wrapper (5 marks)
3) Anti-avoidance provisions and risk minimization (7 marks)

**TIME ALLOCATION**: 35 minutes total

---

**ANSWER** (using Template D - Extract):

**PART 1: TAX FEATURES OF OFFSHORE INSURANCE BONDS**

**Tax Treatment Under ITTOIA 2005 Part 4 Chapter 9**

Offshore insurance bonds (sometimes called "wrappers") provide tax-deferred growth:

✓ **No annual tax charge**: Investment returns (income and gains) accumulate within the bond WITHOUT annual UK income tax or capital gains tax.

✓ **Tax on encashment only**: Tax arises only on a "chargeable event" under ITTOIA 2005 s.484, typically:
  - Full or partial surrender/withdrawal
  - Maturity of bond
  - Death of bondholder

✓ **5% annual withdrawal allowance**: Under the 5/5ths rule, Freja can withdraw up to 5% of the initial premium each year without triggering a taxable chargeable event. Unused allowances accumulate.

Example: If Freja invests £1 million:
- Year 1: Can withdraw £50,000 tax-free
- Year 2: Can withdraw £100,000 tax-free (if nothing taken in Year 1)
- Year 5: Can withdraw £250,000 tax-free (5 years × 5% = 25%)

Therefore, Freja's plan to withdraw 20% in year 5 falls within this tax-free limit.

[Annotation: ✓ Clear explanation of tax deferral - worth 3-4 marks]

**Remittance Basis Interaction**

HOWEVER, as Freja is on the remittance basis:

⚠️ **Capital used to fund bond**: If Freja transfers her existing portfolios (or sale proceeds) into the wrapper, this constitutes a DISPOSAL and may generate capital gains taxable on remittance basis.

⚠️ **Withdrawals = potential remittances**: Although the 5% withdrawal is not subject to UK tax under bond rules, if Freja remits these withdrawals to the UK, this could constitute taxable remittances under ITA 2007 s.809L.

**Why?** If the portfolio used to fund the wrapper was originally acquired using unremitted foreign income or gains (while Freja was on remittance basis), then withdrawals from the wrapper may contain "tainted" offshore income/gains.

**Result**: Even "tax-free" 5% withdrawals become taxable if remitted to UK.

[Annotation: ✓✓ Excellent point - shows understanding of interaction between bond rules and remittance basis. Worth 3-4 marks.]

---

**PART 2: WHICH INVESTMENTS CAN BE HELD IN WRAPPER?**

The bond should invest in **listed shares and bonds** that would normally be held by an insurance company for public policyholders.

✓ **Foreign listed shares**: Freja's foreign share portfolio appears suitable, provided it contains standard publicly-traded securities.

❌ **Private equity fund**: Would NOT be suitable. Private equity involves:
  - Bespoke investments not available to general public
  - Significant capital calls over several years
  - Heightened risk of Personal Portfolio Bond (PPB) legislation applying

❌ **Family company shares**: NOT suitable. These are personal/bespoke assets that an insurance company would not normally hold for public policyholders.

**General Rule**: The wrapper should only hold investments which a discretionary investment manager would propose to the "public" - i.e., standard, publicly-available investments.

[Annotation: ✓ Application to specific facts - worth 4-5 marks]

---

**PART 3: ANTI-AVOIDANCE PROVISIONS**

**Risk 1: Transfer of Assets Abroad (TOAA) - ITA 2007 s.720**

If TOAA applies, the underlying income arising in the bond would be assessed on Freja on an **arising basis** (not remittance basis) - defeating the purpose of the wrapper.

However, the case of **IRC v Willoughby [1995] STC 143** supports the position that where a bond is held directly as part of a normal investment strategy, HMRC should not succeed in invoking TOAA s.720.

**Key requirement**: The wrapper must be a **genuine investment**, not a tax avoidance scheme.

[Annotation: ✓ Correct case citation and application - 2 marks]

**Risk 2: Personal Portfolio Bond (PPB) Legislation - ITTOIA 2005 ss.515-526**

This is the **primary risk** for Freja.

If the bond is a PPB, then:
❌ Annual income tax charge applies (not tax-deferred)
❌ Bond gains taxed on arising basis each year
❌ Loses all benefits of the wrapper structure

**When is a bond a PPB?**

Under ITTOIA 2005 s.516, a bond is a PPB if the policyholder (or related person) has the power to SELECT the investments held in the bond.

⚠️ **FREJA'S RISK IS HIGH**: The question states:
- "Freja is a hands-on investor"
- "Personally selects each stock"
- "Prefers not to use a discretionary investment manager"

This means Freja retains control over investment selection → HIGH RISK of PPB classification.

**HMRC Guidance (IPTM7730)**: A bond may be a PPB even where control is exercised indirectly through a "restricted investment policy." If investment objectives given to the adviser/broker are so restricted that it is effectively the policyholder selecting property, the adviser/broker is "no more than a conduit."

[Annotation: ✓✓ Identifying the key risk specific to facts - worth 4-5 marks]

**RECOMMENDATIONS TO MINIMIZE RISK**:

To avoid PPB classification, Freja must:

1. ✓ **Relinquish control**: Become a passive investor, not "hands-on"
2. ✓ **Use discretionary investment manager**: Give manager full discretion over investment selection
3. ✓ **No restrictive mandates**: Do NOT give specific investment guidelines that effectively control what manager can invest in
4. ✓ **Hold only public investments**: Avoid bespoke assets (family company shares, private equity)

**Conclusion**: An offshore wrapper may provide tax benefits for Freja, but ONLY if:
- She transfers ONLY the publicly-traded foreign share portfolio (not private equity or family company)
- She relinquishes control to a discretionary investment manager
- She accepts being a passive investor

If Freja cannot accept these conditions, the wrapper is NOT suitable and will likely be classified as a PPB with adverse tax consequences.

### Error Prevention: Top 10 Mistakes (Remittance Basis)

**MISTAKE #1**: "Confusing eligibility with claiming"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Non-dom = automatic remittance basis forever"
- ✅ **Correct**: "Automatic for first 6 years; must CLAIM from year 7+ (with RBC)"
- **Prevention**: Always check: How many years UK resident?

**MISTAKE #2**: "Forgetting the Remittance Basis Charge (RBC)"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Non-dom pays tax only on remittances" [stops there]
- ✅ **Correct**: "If 7+ years resident, must pay RBC (£30k or £60k) IN ADDITION to tax on remittances"
- **Mark impact**: Missing RBC = lose 3-4 marks

**MISTAKE #3**: "Not understanding what counts as a 'remittance'"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Only bank transfers to UK are remittances"
- ✅ **Correct**: "Remittance = brought to, received in, or USED in UK for relevant person"
- **Examples**: Offshore credit card used in UK = remittance; gift to spouse = remittance

**MISTAKE #4**: "Ignoring mixed funds ordering rules"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Can choose which funds to remit from mixed account"
- ✅ **Correct**: "s.809Q ordering: income first (taxed), then gains, then clean capital"
- **Solution**: Recommend separate accounts in answer

**MISTAKE #5**: "Missing the PPB anti-avoidance for offshore bonds"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Discussing wrapper benefits without mentioning PPB risk
- ✅ **Correct**: "Wrapper provides deferral UNLESS it's a PPB due to selection power"
- **Examiner loves**: Spotting that "hands-on investor" = PPB risk

**MISTAKE #6**: "Confusing TOAA with PPB"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Using these terms interchangeably
- ✅ **Correct**: TOAA = general anti-avoidance (s.720); PPB = specific to insurance bonds (ss.515-526)
- **Prevention**: Cite correct legislation for each

**MISTAKE #7**: "Assuming all non-doms want remittance basis"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Non-dom should always claim remittance basis"
- ✅ **Correct**: "Trade-off analysis: RBC + loss of allowances vs tax on worldwide income"
- **Professional approach**: Discuss pros/cons, not automatic recommendation

**MISTAKE #8**: "Not distinguishing clean capital from tainted income"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "All funds in offshore account are the same"
- ✅ **Correct**: "Clean capital (pre-UK arrival) ≠ foreign income (while UK resident on remittance basis)"
- **Why it matters**: Clean capital can be remitted tax-free

**MISTAKE #9**: "Forgetting Business Investment Relief (BIR)"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Not mentioning BIR when question involves UK business investment
- ✅ **Correct**: "Under ss.809VA-809VO, can remit for qualifying UK trading investment within 45 days"
- **When relevant**: Question mentions investing in UK company

**MISTAKE #10**: "Knowledge dumping about remittance basis generally"
- ❌ **Wrong**: 3 pages explaining all remittance basis rules without applying to facts
- ✅ **Correct**: 1 paragraph on rules + 2 paragraphs applying to specific facts in question
- **Golden rule**: 20% law / 80% application

### Quick Reference: Remittance Basis Key Points

**Eligibility**:
- UK resident + non-UK domiciled (or not deemed domiciled) = eligible

**Automatic vs Claim**:
- Automatic: If (a) unremitted foreign income/gains <£2k, OR (b) no UK income/gains, OR (c) UK resident <7 of last 9 years
- Must claim: If UK resident 7+ years AND want remittance basis
- Claiming means: ❌ Lose personal allowance, ❌ Lose CGT exemption

**Remittance Basis Charge (RBC)**:
- 7-11 years resident (of last 14): £30,000
- 12+ years resident (of last 14): £60,000
- RBC is IN ADDITION to tax on actual remittances

**What is a Remittance?** (s.809L):
- Brought to UK
- Received in UK
- Used in UK for benefit of relevant person (self/spouse/minor children)

**Mixed Funds Ordering** (s.809Q):
1. Income (oldest first) - TAXED
2. Capital gains (oldest first) - TAXED
3. Clean capital - NOT TAXED

**Business Investment Relief** (ss.809VA-809VO):
- Can remit foreign income/gains tax-free IF invested in qualifying UK trading company within 45 days

**Anti-Avoidance**:

| Provision | Legislation | Effect | Prevention |
|-----------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Transfer of Assets Abroad (TOAA) | ITA 2007 ss.714-751 | Income of offshore structure taxed on transferor (arising basis) | Motive defense (s.741) - genuine commercial purpose |
| Personal Portfolio Bonds (PPB) | ITTOIA 2005 ss.515-526 | Annual tax charge on bond (not deferred) | Use discretionary manager, no selection power |

**Key Cases**:
- **IRC v Willoughby [1995]**: Normal investment in offshore bond should not trigger TOAA

**Time Management Targets**:
- Eligibility + automatic vs claim: 3-4 minutes
- RBC calculation: 2-3 minutes
- What constitutes remittance: 5-6 minutes
- Mixed funds (if relevant): 3-4 minutes
- BIR (if relevant): 3-4 minutes
- Anti-avoidance (PPB/TOAA): 8-10 minutes
- Recommendations: 2-3 minutes
- **TOTAL**: 26-37 minutes (depending on complexity)

**Mark Allocation Patterns** (Part B - 20 marks):
- Eligibility and claiming process: 2-3 marks
- RBC calculation: 2-3 marks
- What constitutes remittance / application: 4-5 marks
- Anti-avoidance identification: 4-6 marks
- Practical recommendations: 3-4 marks
- Professional skepticism/risk assessment: 2-3 marks

## 2.1.5 Double Tax Relief & Temporary Non-Residence (TNR)

### Pattern Recognition: Spotting This Question Type

**Immediate Triggers** (if you see these words, deploy this template):
- "Temporary non-residence," "TNR," "4 out of 7 years"
- "Left the UK," "period of non-residence," "returns to UK"
- "Double tax relief," "credit relief," "foreign tax credit"
- "Treaty relief," "bilateral relief," "unilateral relief"
- "Gains arising during non-residence," "capital gains on return"
- "Disregarded income," "close company dividends"

**Frequency**: TNR appears in ~40% of exams, DTR in ~55%

**Typical Mark Allocation**:
- Part A integrated question: 5-8 marks
- Part B standalone: 15-18 marks (if combined with residence/remittance)

**Recent Appearances**:
- **June 2025 Q1 Part 3** (5 marks): Daniel Door - TNR application to gains and dividends
- **December 2024 Q1 Part 2** (6 marks): Combined TNR and DTR on property disposal
- **June 2024 Q2 Part 4** (8 marks): DTR calculation with treaty relief

---

### Strategic Context: When and Why This Appears

**Why Examiners Love This Topic**:

1. **Tests Multiple Technical Areas**:
   - Residence rules (prerequisite for TNR)
   - Capital gains tax timing
   - Close company rules
   - Treaty interpretation
   - Credit relief mechanics

2. **Real-World Relevance**:
   - Common with internationally mobile individuals
   - Prevents avoidance through temporary emigration
   - Tests understanding of UK's territorial scope

3. **Integration Opportunities**:
   - Often combined with SRT analysis (did they actually leave?)
   - May involve remittance basis (if non-dom before leaving)
   - Links to deemed domicile rules

**Common Exam Scenarios**:

| Scenario | What They Test | Typical Marks |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| UK resident leaves, sells assets while non-resident, returns within 5 years | TNR catch, timing of taxation, asset types | 5-8 marks |
| Close company dividend received during non-residence | TNR income rules, s.811 disregarded income | 3-5 marks |
| Foreign tax paid on gains/income, returns to UK | DTR calculation, treaty vs unilateral relief | 6-10 marks |
| UK land disposal during non-residence | Exception from TNR, direct taxation | 3-4 marks |

### Execution Framework: Step-by-Step Application

**Time Budget**:
- Simple TNR question (5 marks): 6-8 minutes
- DTR calculation (8 marks): 10-12 minutes
- Complex combined (15 marks): 18-22 minutes

#### STEP 1: Establish TNR Conditions (2-3 minutes)

**The Three TNR Tests**:

1. **Prior Residence Test**:
   - Was individual UK resident for **at least 4 of the 7 tax years** immediately before departure?
   - Count the year of departure as full year (even if split year)
   - Must count backwards from year BEFORE departure year

2. **Period of Non-Residence Test**:
   - Did period of non-residence exceed **5 tax years**?
   - If YES → TNR does NOT apply (successfully avoided UK tax)
   - If NO → TNR APPLIES (caught by anti-avoidance)

3. **Return to UK Test**:
   - Did individual become UK resident again?
   - In which tax year did they return?
   - This is the year of taxation for TNR gains/income

**Critical Timing Issue**:
- "5 tax years" means 5 complete tax years of non-residence
- Example: Leave 2023/24 (non-resident), return 2024/25 (resident) = only 1 year non-resident → TNR applies
- Example: Leave 2018/19, non-resident 2019/20-2023/24 (5 years), return 2024/25 → TNR does NOT apply

#### STEP 2: Identify Assets/Income Within TNR Scope (3-4 minutes)

**Capital Gains - TNR Applies To**:
- Assets **owned BEFORE departure** from UK
- Disposals made **during period of non-residence**
- **NOT** interests in UK land (these are taxed directly on non-residents under TCGA 1992 Sch 4ZZA)

**Capital Gains - TNR Does NOT Apply To**:
- Assets acquired AFTER departure
- Disposals after return to UK (taxed normally as resident)
- UK residential property interests (already taxable on non-residents)

**Income - TNR Applies To**:
- Distributions (dividends) from **close companies** (CTA 2010 s.439)
- Received during period of non-residence

**Income - Exceptions (s.811 Disregarded Income)**:
- Dividends from **public listed companies** (not close companies)
- Foreign source income (not UK-connected)
- Employment income from non-UK duties

**Legislation**: ITA 2007 ss.809A-809H (TNR rules), s.811 (disregarded income)

#### STEP 3: Calculate TNR Tax Charge (2-3 minutes)

**For Capital Gains**:

```
TNR Gain Taxable in Year of Return = Gains on pre-departure assets disposed during non-residence
```

**Tax Rate on Return**:
- Apply CGT rates in year of return (currently 18%/24% for residential property, 10%/20% for other assets)
- Higher rate if individual is higher/additional rate taxpayer in year of return
- May use annual exempt amount for year of return (£3,000 for 2024/25)

**For Close Company Dividends**:
- Income taxed at dividend rates in year of return
- Dividend allowance applies (£500 for 2024/25)
- 8.75% (basic), 33.75% (higher), 39.35% (additional)

#### STEP 4: Apply Double Tax Relief (DTR) if Applicable (4-6 minutes)

**Two Types of Relief**:

1. **Treaty Relief (Bilateral)**:
   - Available if UK has DTA with source country
   - Credit for foreign tax paid (lower of UK tax or foreign tax)
   - Must reduce foreign tax by claiming treaty reliefs FIRST (ITA 2007 s.6A)

2. **Unilateral Relief** (TIOPA 2010 Part 2):
   - Available for tax paid to non-treaty countries
   - Credit = lower of:
     - Foreign tax paid on the income/gain, OR
     - UK tax payable on that same income/gain
   - Calculated on a source-by-source basis

**DTR Calculation Formula**:

```
DTR Credit = LOWER OF:
(a) Foreign tax actually paid on the income/gain
(b) UK tax on that income/gain (UK rate × foreign income/gain)
```

**Key Restriction**:
- DTR cannot create a repayment
- Can only reduce UK tax to zero (cannot go negative)
- Excess foreign tax is "wasted" (no refund, no carry forward)

**Documentation Required**:
- Evidence of foreign tax paid (tax certificate from source country)
- Proof of treaty claim made in source country (if reducing withholding)
- Calculation of UK tax on same income/gain

#### STEP 5: Identify Relief Ordering Issues (1-2 minutes)

**Order of Relief Application**:

1. Apply treaty/unilateral DTR first
2. Then apply losses (if any)
3. Then apply personal allowances/exemptions

**Common Pitfall**:
- If foreign tax was reduced by treaty relief in source country, UK DTR is based on ACTUAL foreign tax paid (not notional rate)
- Example: 30% WHT reduced to 10% by treaty → DTR credit is 10%, not 30%

### Template E: Double Tax Relief & Temporary Non-Residence Analysis

**Use this template when**: Question involves someone leaving UK, disposing of assets/receiving income during non-residence, and returning to UK.

**Format**: Professional advice letter or memo format

**Estimated time to complete**: 15-20 minutes (for full analysis)

---

**TEMPORARY NON-RESIDENCE ANALYSIS: [Name]**
**Tax Year of Return**: 202X/2X

---

#### 1. TNR CONDITIONS - DO THE RULES APPLY?

Under ITA 2007 s.809H, the temporary non-residence rules apply where an individual:

**(a) Prior Residence**: Was UK resident for **at least 4 of the 7 tax years** immediately before the year of departure

**[Name]'s Position**:
- Departure year: [Tax Year]
- Years of UK residence in 7 years before departure: [X] years
  - [List specific years: e.g., 2016/17, 2017/18, etc.]
- **Condition [MET / NOT MET]**

**(b) Period of Non-Residence**: Left the UK and was non-UK resident for a period **not exceeding 5 tax years**

**[Name]'s Position**:
- Non-resident from: [Start date] to [End date]
- Tax years of non-residence: [List years]
- Total period: [X] tax years
- **Condition [MET / NOT MET]**

**(c) Return to UK**: Became UK resident again in tax year [202X/2X]

**CONCLUSION**: The TNR rules [DO / DO NOT] apply to [Name].

---

#### 2. ASSETS/INCOME WITHIN TNR SCOPE

**Capital Gains During Non-Residence**:

| Asset | Acquisition Date | Disposal Date | Gain | TNR Applies? | Reason |
|-------|------------------|---------------|------|--------------|--------|
| [Asset 1] | [Date] | [Date] | £[X]m | YES/NO | Owned before departure / UK land exception / etc. |
| [Asset 2] | [Date] | [Date] | £[X]m | YES/NO | [Reason] |

**Total Gains Subject to TNR**: £[X] million

**Exception - UK Land**:
Disposals of interests in UK land are **NOT** subject to TNR rules. Such disposals are directly taxable on non-UK residents under TCGA 1992 Sch 4ZZA. Therefore, [describe any UK land disposals and note they were already subject to UK CGT during non-residence].

**Income During Non-Residence**:

| Income Source | Amount | Close Company? | TNR Applies? | Reason |
|---------------|--------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| Dividend from [Company] | £[X]m | YES/NO | YES/NO | s.811 disregarded income / Close company TNR / etc. |

**Disregarded Income (s.811)**:
Dividends from **public listed companies** are NOT subject to TNR rules and qualify for relief under the disregarded income provisions in ITA 2007 s.811. Therefore, the £[X] million dividend from [Company Name], a public listed company, is **not taxable** in the UK in the year of return.

**Close Company Dividends**:
Dividends from **close companies** received during the period of non-residence [ARE / ARE NOT] subject to TNR. [If applicable: The £[X] dividend from [Company] will be taxable in 202X/2X.]

---

#### 3. TAXATION IN YEAR OF RETURN: 202X/2X

**Capital Gains Tax**:

Under ITA 2007 s.809H, gains arising during the period of non-residency on assets owned prior to departure are **treated as arising in the tax year of return** to the UK.

```
Taxable Capital Gains (Year of Return 202X/2X):
Disposal of [Asset 1]                           £[X] million
Disposal of [Asset 2]                           £[X] million
                                               ___________
Total Chargeable Gains                          £[X] million
Less: Annual Exempt Amount (202X/2X)            (£[X])
                                               ___________
Taxable Gains                                   £[X] million
                                               ===========

Capital Gains Tax:
£[X]m @ [20%] (higher rate)                     £[X] million
```

**Note**: The gains are taxed at the CGT rates applicable in the year of return (202X/2X), not the rates when the disposal occurred.

**Income Tax (if close company dividends)**:

```
Dividend Income (Year of Return 202X/2X):
Dividend from [Close Company]                   £[X]
Less: Dividend Allowance                        (£[X])
                                               ________
Taxable Dividend Income                         £[X]
                                               ========

Income Tax:
£[X] @ [33.75%] (higher rate dividend)          £[X]
```

---

#### 4. DOUBLE TAX RELIEF (if foreign tax paid)

**Foreign Tax Paid**:
- Country: [Name of country]
- Type of tax: [Capital gains tax / income tax / withholding tax]
- Amount paid: £[X] / [Foreign currency amount]
- Rate: [X]%

**Relief Available**:

[Name] is entitled to relief for foreign tax paid under [the UK-[Country] Double Taxation Agreement / unilateral relief provisions in TIOPA 2010 Part 2].

**DTR Calculation** (per ITA 2007 s.6A / TIOPA 2010 s.18):

```
Credit Relief = LOWER OF:
(a) Foreign tax paid: £[X]
(b) UK tax on same income/gain: £[X]

DTR Credit Available: £[X]
```

**Requirement to Claim Treaty Relief**:
Under ITA 2007 s.6A, [Name] must reduce the foreign tax by making any applicable claim under the DTA **before** calculating UK DTR. [If applicable: The foreign withholding tax of [X]% was reduced to [Y]% under Article [Z] of the treaty, meaning the actual foreign tax paid was £[X].]

**Net UK Tax Payable**:

```
UK Tax on Foreign Gains/Income                  £[X]
Less: DTR Credit                                (£[X])
                                               ________
Net UK Tax Payable                              £[X]
                                               ========
```

**Excess Foreign Tax**:
[If applicable: Note that foreign tax of £[X] exceeds the UK tax on the same income. This excess cannot be refunded or carried forward - it is "wasted" under UK DTR rules.]

---

#### 5. PLANNING OPPORTUNITIES / RECOMMENDATIONS

**Timing of Return**:
- To avoid TNR, [Name] would need to remain non-UK resident for **more than 5 complete tax years**
- Current position: [X] years of non-residence
- To escape TNR: Must remain non-resident until [Date]

**Asset Management**:
- Consider deferring disposals until after return to UK (if beneficial)
- Or accelerate disposals while non-resident if foreign tax rate lower than UK
- UK land disposals are taxed regardless of TNR status

**DTR Optimization**:
- Ensure all treaty claims made in source country to minimize withholding
- Obtain tax certificates for all foreign tax paid
- Consider timing of remittances if still on remittance basis

**Close Company Dividends**:
- If possible, convert to non-close company status before paying dividends
- OR delay dividends until after return to UK (but TNR will still apply)
- Consider alternative extraction methods (salary, loan repayment)

#### 6. SUMMARY OF TAX POSITION

| Item | Tax Year | Amount | Treatment |
|------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Gain on [Asset] disposal | 202X/2X (year of return) | £[X]m | Taxed under TNR rules |
| Dividend from [Company] | 202X/2X (year of return) | £[X]m | s.811 disregarded income - not taxable |
| Foreign tax credit | 202X/2X | £[X] | DTR relief available |
| **Net UK Tax** | **202X/2X** | **£[X]m** | **Payable by 31 Jan 202X** |

---

### Worked Example: June 2025 Q1 Part 3 - Daniel Door TNR Analysis

**Question Summary** (5 marks, suggested time 7-8 minutes):

Daniel Door left the UK on 1 April 2023 (became non-resident in 2023/24). Before leaving, he had always been UK resident. He became UK resident again in 2024/25 (spending 98 days in UK). During 2023/24 (while non-resident):
- Sold shares in AI-5 (public listed company) for £160 million gain
- Received £40 million dividend from AI-5

**Question**: What are the UK tax implications under the temporary non-residence rules?

---

**SUGGESTED SOLUTION** (following Template E structure):

**TEMPORARY NON-RESIDENCE ANALYSIS: DANIEL DOOR**
**Tax Year of Return**: 2024/25

---

**1. TNR CONDITIONS - DO THE RULES APPLY?**

The temporary non-residence (TNR) rule under ITA 2007 s.809H applies where an individual:
- (a) Has been UK resident for **at least 4 of the 7 tax years prior to departure**, AND
- (b) Leaves the UK and returns after a period **not exceeding 5 tax years**

**Daniel's Position**:

**(a) Prior Residence**: Daniel had **always been UK resident** before leaving on 1 April 2023. He clearly satisfies the 4 out of 7 year condition.

**(b) Period of Non-Residence**:
- Daniel was non-UK resident in 2023/24
- He became UK resident again in 2024/25
- Therefore, he did **NOT** meet the requirement to be non-UK resident for more than 5 years

**CONCLUSION**: The TNR rules **DO apply** to Daniel.

---

**2. CAPITAL GAINS DURING NON-RESIDENCE**

Under ITA 2007 s.809H, if the TNR conditions are met, any **capital gains arising during the period of non-residency** on assets owned **prior to departure** from the UK will be **treated as having arisen in the tax year of return** and taxed accordingly.

**Exception - UK Land**: This does NOT apply to disposals of interests in UK land, which continue to be subject to tax on non-UK residents under TCGA 1992 Sch 4ZZA.

**Daniel's Position**:
- Disposal of AI-5 shares in 2023/24: **£160 million gain**
- AI-5 shares are NOT interests in UK land
- Shares were owned before departure (implied by fact pattern)
- Therefore, the £160 million gain will be **subject to UK capital gains tax in 2024/25** (the year of Daniel's return)

---

**3. DIVIDEND INCOME DURING NON-RESIDENCE**

The TNR rules also apply to various types of income, including distributions (dividends) from **close companies** (as defined in CTA 2010 s.439).

**s.811 Disregarded Income Exception**:
Dividends from **public listed companies** qualify for relief under the disregarded income rules in ITA 2007 s.811 and are NOT subject to TNR.

**Daniel's Position**:
- AI-5 is a **public listed company** (stated in question)
- Therefore, AI-5 should **NOT** be treated as a close company
- The £40 million dividend received from AI-5, though subject to UK tax in general terms, **qualifies for relief under s.811**
- **Conclusion**: The dividend is **NOT taxable** in the UK under TNR rules

---

**4. SUMMARY OF UK TAX POSITION**

| Item | Amount | Tax Treatment |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Capital gain on AI-5 shares (2023/24) | £160 million | **Taxable in 2024/25** under TNR rules (ITA 2007 s.809H) |
| Dividend from AI-5 (2023/24) | £40 million | **Not taxable** - s.811 disregarded income (public company exception) |

**Tax Computation for 2024/25**:

```
Chargeable Gains (TNR catch):
Disposal of AI-5 shares                         £160,000,000
Less: Annual Exempt Amount (2024/25)            (£3,000)
                                               _____________
Taxable Gains                                   £159,997,000
                                               =============

Capital Gains Tax (assuming higher rate):
£159,997,000 @ 20%                              £31,999,400
```

**Dividend**: £40 million - no UK tax liability due to s.811 disregarded income relief.

---

**Examiner's Marking Approach** (5 marks total):

| Point | Marks |
|-------|-------|
| TNR conditions identified (4 out of 7 years + not exceeding 5 years) | 1 mark |
| TNR applies to Daniel (satisfied conditions) | 0.5 marks |
| Gain of £160m taxable in year of return (2024/25) under s.809H | 1.5 marks |
| AI-5 is public company, therefore not close company | 0.5 marks |
| Dividend qualifies for s.811 disregarded income relief | 1 mark |
| Conclusion: gain taxable, dividend not taxable | 0.5 marks |
| **Total** | **5 marks** |

---

**Time Management**:
- Read and identify TNR trigger: 1 minute
- Apply 4/7 year and 5-year tests: 1.5 minutes
- Capital gains analysis: 2 minutes
- Dividend/s.811 analysis: 1.5 minutes
- Write conclusion: 1 minute
- **Total: 7 minutes** (comfortably within 8-minute target for 5 marks)

### Error Prevention: Top 10 Mistakes to Avoid

#### Mistake #1: Confusing "4 out of 7" with "7 out of 10"
**❌ Wrong**: "TNR applies if UK resident for 7 out of 10 years before departure"
**✅ Right**: "TNR applies if UK resident for **at least 4 of the 7 tax years** immediately before the year of departure"

**Why it matters**: Gets 0 marks for incorrect statutory test. The "4 out of 7" test is for TNR; "15 out of 20" is for deemed domicile.

---

#### Mistake #2: Thinking 5 Years Means 5 Calendar Years
**❌ Wrong**: "Left March 2020, returned April 2025 = 5 calendar years = TNR doesn't apply"
**✅ Right**: "Count complete **tax years of non-residence**. If only 4 full tax years as non-resident, TNR still applies"

**Why it matters**: Difference between escaping TNR or being caught. Must count tax years, not calendar years.

---

#### Mistake #3: Applying TNR to UK Land Disposals
**❌ Wrong**: "Sold UK property while non-resident. Gain taxed under TNR in year of return"
**✅ Right**: "UK land disposals are **NOT** subject to TNR. They are directly taxable on non-residents under TCGA 1992 Sch 4ZZA at time of disposal"

**Why it matters**: Loses 2-3 marks for wrong timing and wrong rule. UK land is specifically excluded from TNR.

---

#### Mistake #4: Forgetting s.811 Disregarded Income for Public Company Dividends
**❌ Wrong**: "Received dividend during non-residence. TNR applies to all dividends."
**✅ Right**: "TNR applies to **close company** dividends only. Public company dividends qualify for s.811 disregarded income relief"

**Why it matters**: Loses 1-2 marks. Must distinguish close vs public companies.

---

#### Mistake #5: Applying TNR to Assets Acquired After Departure
**❌ Wrong**: "Bought shares while non-resident, sold them, then returned to UK. TNR applies."
**✅ Right**: "TNR only applies to assets **owned BEFORE departure**. Assets acquired during non-residence escape TNR"

**Why it matters**: Fundamental misunderstanding of anti-avoidance purpose. TNR targets pre-departure assets only.

---

#### Mistake #6: Wrong Tax Year for TNR Gains
**❌ Wrong**: "Gain arose in 2023/24, so taxed in 2023/24"
**✅ Right**: "Gain arose in 2023/24, but **treated as arising in year of return** (2024/25) under TNR rules"

**Why it matters**: Gets timing completely wrong. The whole point of TNR is to defer taxation to year of return.

---

#### Mistake #7: DTR Calculation Using Wrong Tax
**❌ Wrong**: "Foreign WHT 30% by treaty reduced to 10%. DTR credit = 30%"
**✅ Right**: "DTR based on **actual tax paid** after treaty relief. If 10% paid after treaty, DTR = 10% (s.6A requires treaty claims first)"

**Why it matters**: Overstates DTR credit, loses 2-3 marks in calculation.

---

#### Mistake #8: Thinking Excess Foreign Tax Can Be Refunded
**❌ Wrong**: "Foreign tax £10k, UK tax £7k, so get £3k refund"
**✅ Right**: "DTR = lower of foreign (£10k) or UK tax (£7k) = £7k. Excess £3k is **wasted** (no refund or c/f)"

**Why it matters**: Shows lack of understanding of credit relief mechanics. Excess foreign tax is lost.

---

#### Mistake #9: Ignoring Close Company Definition
**❌ Wrong**: "Company has 10 shareholders, so not a close company"
**✅ Right**: "Close company under CTA 2010 s.439 = controlled by 5 or fewer participators OR any number of director-participators. Must check control, not just number of shareholders"

**Why it matters**: Wrong conclusion on whether TNR applies to dividends. Could lose 2-4 marks.

---

#### Mistake #10: Not Counting Departure Year Correctly for 4/7 Test
**❌ Wrong**: "Left in 2023/24, so count 2023/24 back to 2016/17 = 7 years"
**✅ Right**: "Count 7 years **immediately BEFORE the year of departure**. If left in 2023/24, count 2022/23 back to 2016/17"

**Why it matters**: Gets the 4/7 test wrong, fundamental error. The departure year itself is not counted in the "7 years before departure."

---

### Quick Reference: TNR & DTR Essentials

**TNR Statutory Tests (ITA 2007 s.809H)**:
```
1. UK resident 4+ of 7 years before departure    ✓
2. Non-resident period ≤ 5 tax years             ✓
3. Returns to UK residence                        ✓
→ TNR APPLIES
```

**TNR Scope**:
- ✅ Capital gains on pre-departure assets (except UK land)
- ✅ Close company dividends during non-residence
- ❌ UK land disposals (taxed directly under Sch 4ZZA)
- ❌ Public company dividends (s.811 disregarded income)
- ❌ Assets acquired after departure

**DTR Formula**:
```
Credit = LOWER OF:
  (a) Foreign tax actually paid (after treaty claims)
  (b) UK tax on same income/gain
```

**Key Legislation**:
- ITA 2007 s.809H (TNR rules)
- ITA 2007 s.811 (disregarded income)
- ITA 2007 s.6A (treaty relief priority)
- TCGA 1992 Sch 4ZZA (non-resident CGT - UK land)
- CTA 2010 s.439 (close company definition)
- TIOPA 2010 Part 2 (unilateral relief)

**Common Mark Traps**:
- Forgetting s.811 exception for public companies: -1 to -2 marks
- Wrong timing (taxing in year of disposal vs year of return): -2 to -3 marks
- Applying TNR to UK land: -2 marks
- Wrong DTR calculation (using treaty rate not actual tax): -2 to -4 marks

**Time Allocation (Part A question, 5-8 marks)**:
- Identify TNR conditions: 1-2 minutes
- Apply to facts: 2-3 minutes
- Calculate/conclude: 2-3 minutes
- Total: 6-8 minutes
