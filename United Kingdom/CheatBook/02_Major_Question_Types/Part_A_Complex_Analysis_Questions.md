# CHAPTER 02: MAJOR QUESTION TYPES

## PART A: Complex Analysis Questions (50 marks)

### Overview: The High-Stakes Backbone

Part A questions are the **heaviest weighted** section of the ADIT UK exam, accounting for **50 out of 100 marks** (50% of your total score). You must answer **BOTH questions** in Part A, with each worth 25 marks.

**Time Allocation**: You should spend approximately **90 minutes** (1.5 hours) on Part A—about **45 minutes per question** based on the 1.8 minutes-per-mark rule.

### Strategic Importance

From Chapter 01, you learned that certain topics appear with remarkable consistency:

| Topic | Frequency (2020-2025) | Strategic Priority |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Individual Residence (SRT)** | 100% (8/8 exams) | CRITICAL - GUARANTEED |
| **Domicile** | 88% (7/8 exams) | CRITICAL |
| **Remittance Basis** | 75% (6/8 exams) | CRITICAL |
| **Corporate Residence & PE** | 63% (5/8 exams) | HIGH |
| **Permanent Establishment** | 63% (5/8 exams) | HIGH |

**Key Insight**: If you master the templates in this chapter for Individual Residence, Corporate Residence/PE, and Remittance Basis, you will be prepared for approximately **75-80% of all Part A questions**.

### Part A Question Characteristics

**Common Features:**
- **Fact-dense scenarios** (200-400 words of facts)
- **Multi-jurisdictional** (typically involving 2-3 countries)
- **Multi-part requirements** (usually 2-4 sub-questions)
- **Integrated topics** (e.g., residence + treaty + temporary non-residence)
- **Recent legislative changes** (examiners love testing new rules)

**What Examiners Reward** (from Examiner Psychology):
1. **Structured analysis** - Clear headings and logical flow (10-15% of marks)
2. **Application to facts** - Linking rules to specific scenario details (40-45% of marks)
3. **Correct legislation citations** - FA 2013 Sch 45, s.809VA ITA 2007, etc. (10-15% of marks)
4. **Balanced conclusions** - "On balance..." or "Insufficient facts to determine conclusively..." (10-15% of marks)
5. **Professional skepticism** - Identifying risks and alternative interpretations (5-10% of marks)

**What Examiners Penalize:**
- ❌ Knowledge dumping without application to facts
- ❌ Ignoring specific facts provided in the question
- ❌ Failing to answer all parts of multi-part questions
- ❌ Generic statements without technical depth
- ❌ Poor structure making marking difficult

### Execution Priorities for Exam Day

**During Reading Time / First 10 Minutes:**

1. **Identify the topic instantly** (use pattern recognition guides below)
2. **Scan for legislation dates** (recent changes = high probability of being tested)
3. **Count the sub-parts** (ensure you allocate time to answer ALL parts)
4. **Flag facts requiring calculations** (day counts, tax computations, etc.)
5. **Choose your stronger question first** if both are unfamiliar

**During Answer Time:**

```
Minute 0-5:    Plan structure, identify template to use
Minute 5-35:   Execute template (write main answer)
Minute 35-40:  Add specific facts, calculations, legislation citations
Minute 40-43:  Conclusion and professional skepticism points
Minute 43-45:  Quality check (all parts answered? citations included?)
```

**Recovery Tactics:**
- If stuck on Part 1 of a question, move to Part 2 - don't lose marks you CAN earn
- If running out of time, switch to bullet points with legislation references
- Always provide a conclusion even if brief - easier marks than detailed analysis

## Template Matrix: Quick Selection Guide

Use this matrix to instantly identify which template to deploy:

| Question Trigger Words | Template to Use | Typical Marks | Time Allocation |
|------------------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| "Individual," "days in UK," "Statutory Residence Test," "SRT," "ties" | **2.1.2 Individual Residence** | 15-25 marks | 25-30 min |
| "Company," "incorporated," "central management and control," "board meetings," "dual resident" | **2.1.1 Corporate Residence** | 10-20 marks | 20-25 min |
| "Branch," "fixed place," "office," "agency," "conclude contracts," "preparatory or auxiliary" | **2.1.3 Permanent Establishment** | 10-20 marks | 15-20 min |
| "Non-domiciled," "remittance," "foreign income/gains," "arising basis," "RBC," "mixed funds" | **2.1.4 Remittance Basis** | 15-25 marks | 20-25 min |
| "Credit relief," "foreign tax," "double taxation," "temporary non-residence," "left UK," "returning to UK" | **2.1.5 DTR & TNR** | 5-15 marks | 15-20 min |
| "Double tax agreement," "treaty," "tie-breaker," "OECD Model," "Article 4," "POEM" | **2.1.1 + Treaty Overlay** | 5-10 marks | 10-12 min |

**Integration Alert**: Part A questions often **combine** multiple templates. For example:
- Individual Residence (2.1.2) + Treaty Tie-Breaker (2.1.1) + TNR (2.1.5) = 25 marks
- Corporate Residence (2.1.1) + PE (2.1.3) + WHT/Dividends = 25 marks

## 2.1.1 Corporate Residence & Treaty Tie-Breaker

### Pattern Recognition: Spotting This Question Type

**Immediate Triggers** (if you see these words, deploy this template):
- "Company," "incorporated," "Ltd," "SA," "Inc," "GmbH," "Plc"
- "Board meetings," "directors," "central management and control"
- "Strategic decisions," "place of effective management"
- "Dual resident," "treaty tie-breaker," "Article 4"
- "Incorporated in [Country X] but managed from [Country Y]"

**Recent Exam Appearances**:
- June 2025 Q2: Solaris Future SA (Spain incorporation, UK board meetings potential)
- December 2024: (check pattern)
- June 2024: (check pattern)
-Frequency: **63% (5/8 exams 2020-2025)**

**Mark Range**: Typically **10-20 marks** when tested

---

### Strategic Context

**Why This Matters:**
- Corporate residence determines **worldwide tax liability scope**
- Dual residence creates **severe double taxation risk** (no treaty protection)
- UK uses **Central Management and Control (CMC)** test (case law-based)
- Treaties use **Place of Effective Management (POEM)** tie-breaker (OECD Model Article 4)
- **NEW RISK**: Examiners increasingly test scenarios where incorporation ≠ management location

**Time Allocation Strategy:**
- **Standalone corporate residence question**: 15-20 minutes
- **Integrated with PE/dividends/unallowable purpose**: Add 10-15 minutes
- **Treaty tie-breaker analysis**: Add 8-10 minutes

**Difficulty vs. Return Assessment:**
- **Difficulty**: Medium (requires knowledge of case law + treaty)
- **Return**: High (marks come easily if you structure correctly)
- **Efficiency Gain**: Use the template structure below = save 5-7 minutes

### Template & Tools

**TEMPLATE A: Corporate Residence Analysis**

```
CORPORATE RESIDENCE ANALYSIS: [Company Name]

1. INCORPORATION TEST (CTA 2009 s.14)
   
   [Company Name] is incorporated in [Country].
   
   [If UK]: Under s.14 CTA 2009, a company incorporated in the UK is 
   conclusively UK tax resident, regardless of where management is located.
   Therefore, [Company] is UK resident.
   
   [If Foreign]: Under s.14 CTA 2009, [Company] is not UK resident by 
   incorporation. Must consider Central Management and Control test.

2. CENTRAL MANAGEMENT & CONTROL TEST (De Beers Case Law)
   
   Under UK case law (De Beers Consolidated Mines v Howe [1906]), a company  
   is resident where its "real business is carried on," determined by where
   central management and control is located.
   
   Central management and control is located where:
   • Strategic decisions are made ✓/✗
   • Board meetings are held ✓/✗  
   • Directors exercise control ✓/✗
   
   Analysis of facts:
   
   Board Meetings: [State where held, how often, what decisions made]
   → [Fact]: ___________________________________________
   
   Strategic Decisions: [Identify where key decisions are ACTUALLY made]
   → [Fact]: ___________________________________________
   
   Directors' Location: [Note residence of directors, particularly chairman]
   → [Fact]: ___________________________________________
   
   Conclusion: Central management and control is located in [Country] 
   because [reason]. Therefore, [Company] is [Country] tax resident under
   the CMC test.

3. DUAL RESIDENCE ASSESSMENT
   
   [Company] appears to be tax resident in:
   • [Country 1] under [incorporation / CMC / domestic law]
   • [Country 2] under [incorporation / CMC / domestic law]
   
   [If dual resident]: This creates dual residence, which means:
   ⚠️ WARNING: Dual resident companies are excluded from treaty protection
   under most UK DTAs. This creates severe double taxation risk as both
   countries can tax worldwide profits with no relief mechanism.
   
   [If NOT dual resident]: No dual residence issue. Proceed to treaty 
   tie-breaker if both countries claim residence under domestic law.

4. TREATY TIE-BREAKER (If Applicable - OECD Model Article 4(3))
   
   If both [Country A] and [Country B] consider [Company] resident under
   their respective domestic laws, the treaty tie-breaker applies.
   
   Under Article 4(3) of the [Country A]-[Country B] DTA (which follows
   OECD Model), a dual resident company is deemed resident solely in the
   country where its "place of effective management" (POEM) is located.
   
   POEM is where key management and commercial decisions necessary for
   conducting the company's business are made.
   
   Factors indicating POEM location:
   • Where do directors meet? → [Answer with facts]
   • Where are strategic decisions implemented? → [Answer]
   • Where are senior executives located? → [Answer]  
   • Where are key business functions performed? → [Answer]
   
   Conclusion: The POEM is located in [Country] because [reasons based on
   facts]. Therefore, [Company] is treaty resident in [Country] only.
   
   [If unclear]: Insufficient facts to conclusively determine POEM. The
   competent authorities of [Country A] and [Country B] would need to 
   reach agreement via Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) under Article 25
   of the DTA.

5. TAX CONSEQUENCES
   
   As a [Country] tax resident company, [Company] is liable to:
   • [Country] corporation tax on worldwide profits
   • [List specific obligations: filing, payments, etc.]
   • [Note any PE risks in other jurisdictions]
   
6. RECOMMENDATIONS
   
   [If dual residence risk]: Urgently restructure to ensure clear single
   residence. Options include:
   • Relocating board meetings exclusively to one jurisdiction
   • Ensuring strategic decisions made only in [jurisdiction]
   • [Other substance-based recommendations]
   
   [If CMC creates unintended UK residence]: Consider:
   • Relocating directors / board meetings
   • Ensuring UK directors are minority / non-executive
   • Using technology for remote board participation from [home country]
```

### Worked Example: June 2025 Question 2 (Extract)

**QUESTION FACTS** (Simplified - see full question in past papers):

*Solaris Future SA is a solar panel manufacturing company, incorporated and tax resident in Spain. Under Option 2, Solaris UK Ltd will be incorporated in the UK. The board of Solaris UK Ltd will include both UK and Spanish-resident directors, but all board meetings will take place in London.*

**EXAMINER REQUIREMENT**: "The UK corporate tax implications of Option 2."

**TEMPLATE APPLICATION** (with annotations):

---

**ANSWER** (using Template A above):

**CORPORATE RESIDENCE ANALYSIS: Solaris UK Ltd (Option 2)**

**1. INCORPORATION TEST (CTA 2009 s.14)**

Solaris UK Ltd will be incorporated in the United Kingdom.

Under s.14 CTA 2009, a company incorporated in the UK is conclusively UK tax resident, regardless of where its management and control is located. Therefore, **Solaris UK Ltd will be UK tax resident by virtue of incorporation**.

[Annotation: ✓ Quick win - 1-2 marks for citing correct statute and applying to facts]

**2. CENTRAL MANAGEMENT & CONTROL TEST** 

For completeness, I also consider the Central Management and Control (CMC) test, which is based on case law (De Beers Consolidated Mines v Howe [1906]).

Analysis of facts:

**Board Meetings**: All board meetings of Solaris UK Ltd will take place in London (UK).

**Directors' Location**: The board includes both UK-resident and Spanish-resident directors.

**Strategic Decisions**: There is no indication that strategic decisions affecting Solaris UK Ltd are made outside the UK. All decisions appear to be made in London at board meetings.

**Conclusion**: Central management and control of Solaris UK Ltd is located in the UK. This confirms UK tax residence (though this is already conclusive under the incorporation test).

[Annotation: ✓ Shows thoroughness - examiners like seeing both tests even if one is conclusive. Adds 2-3 marks.]

**3. PLACE OF EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT (POEM)**

The question refers to Spanish tax residence. If Spain also considers Solaris UK Ltd tax resident under Spanish domestic law (which is unlikely given UK incorporation and London management), then the POEM test under Article 4(3) of the OECD Model DTA would apply.

However, based on the facts:
- The company is incorporated in the UK
- All board meetings are in London  
- Both central management and control AND place of effective management are clearly in the UK

Therefore, there is no risk of dual residence. The DTA tie-breaker is not required. Solaris UK Ltd is solely UK tax resident.

[Annotation: ✓ Professional skepticism - addressing potential treaty issue even though unlikely. Shows examiner you've thought about all angles. Worth 1-2 marks.]

**4. TAX CONSEQUENCES**

As a UK tax resident company, Solaris UK Ltd will be liable to:

✓ **UK Corporation Tax** on its worldwide profits (s.5 CTA 2009)
✓ **Filing obligations**: Annual CT600 corporate tax return
✓ **Transfer pricing compliance**: All transactions with related parties (Solaris Future SA) must be at arm's length (TIOPA 2010 Part 4)
✓ **Quarterly installment payments**: If profits exceed £1.5m (large company threshold)

[Annotation: ✓ Specific consequences = strong application. Worth 4-5 marks in this type of question.]

**5. RISK: DUAL RESIDENCE OF PARENT (Solaris Future SA)**

⚠️ **IMPORTANT RISK**: The question states some board meetings of Solaris Future SA (the Spanish parent) will be held in the UK.

If strategic decisions for Solaris Future SA are made in the UK, this could result in the Spanish parent company being UK tax resident under the CMC test, even though it is incorporated in Spain.

This would create dual residence:
- Spain would consider Solaris Future SA resident under Spanish law
- UK would consider it resident under CMC test
- **Dual resident companies are excluded from DTA protection**
- Risk of unrelieved double taxation on worldwide profits

**RECOMMENDATION**: Solaris Future SA should NOT hold board meetings in the UK. All strategic decisions should be made exclusively in Spain to preserve Spanish-only tax residence.

[Annotation: ✓✓ Gold star answer - spotting the risk not explicitly asked about shows deep understanding. Examiners LOVE this. Can earn 3-5 bonus marks for professional skepticism.]

**MARK ALLOCATION** (Estimated based on suggested solutions):

| Element | Marks |
|---------|-------|
| Correct citation of s.14 CTA 2009 | 1-2 |
| Application: UK incorporation = UK residence | 2 |
| CMC test explanation (even if not needed) | 2-3 |
| Application of CMC to facts | 2-3 |
| Tax consequences (CT, filing, TP) | 4-5 |
| Dual residence risk identification (parent) | 3-4 |
| Recommendations | 2 |
| **TOTAL** | **16-21/25** |

**Time Taken**: Approximately 18-22 minutes for this level of answer

### Error Prevention: Top 10 Mistakes

**MISTAKE #1**: "Assuming UK incorporation alone is sufficient - not addressing CMC"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Company is UK incorporated so it's UK resident." [Stop]
- ✅ **Correct**: State s.14 CTA 2009, THEN discuss CMC for completeness
- **Why it matters**: Shows thorough understanding, earns extra marks

**MISTAKE #2**: "Confusing Central Management & Control (CMC) with Place of Effective Management (POEM)"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Using these terms interchangeably  
- ✅ **Correct**: CMC = UK domestic law test; POEM = treaty tie-breaker test
- **Prevention**: Always clarify which test you're applying and why

**MISTAKE #3**: "Ignoring dual residence risk"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Not flagging when company appears resident in 2+ countries
- ✅ **Correct**: Explicitly state "dual residence" and warn of no treaty protection
- **Why critical**: This is a major risk that loses significant marks if missed

**MISTAKE #4**: "Citing wrong legislation"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Under FA 2013..." (that's SRT for individuals!)
- ✅ **Correct**: CTA 2009 s.14-18 for corporate residence
- **Prevention**: Memorize key statutes - write them on scrap paper at start of exam

**MISTAKE #5**: "Failing to apply treaty tie-breaker when both countries claim residence"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Company is resident in both UK and Spain." [Stop]
- ✅ **Correct**: Apply Article 4(3) POEM test to determine single treaty residence
- **Why it matters**: Treaty analysis worth 4-6 marks typically

**MISTAKE #6**: "Describing what should happen, not what the facts show"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Board meetings should be held in Spain..."
- ✅ **Correct**: "The facts state board meetings ARE held in [location]..."
- **Golden Rule**: Answer based on facts AS GIVEN, not as they should be

**MISTAKE #7**: "Knowledge dumping without application"
- ❌ **Wrong**: 3 paragraphs about De Beers case + no mention of actual facts
- ✅ **Correct**: 1 sentence citing De Beers + 2 paragraphs applying to specific facts
- **Ratio**: 20% law / 80% application = optimal mark conversion

**MISTAKE #8**: "Missing the 'substance' red flags"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Ignoring facts like "short-term rental," "no role in negotiating contracts"
- ✅ **Correct**: Flag lack of substance → risk of CMC in another country
- **Examiner loves**: When you spot planning risks not explicitly asked about

**MISTAKE #9**: "Forgetting to distinguish 'formal approval' vs 'actual decision-making'"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Board formally approves in Spain so CMC is Spain"
- ✅ **Correct**: "Real decisions made in UK → CMC in UK (rubber-stamp approval in Spain irrelevant)"
- **Case law basis**: Wood v Holden [2006] - where REAL control exercised

**MISTAKE #10**: "Running out of time - no conclusion"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Detailed analysis + no conclusion at end
- ✅ **Correct**: Even if short of time, write: "Conclusion: [Company] is UK resident because [1-2 reasons]"
- **Why critical**: Conclusions worth 2-3 marks and take 30 seconds to write

### Quick Reference: Key Legislation & Cases

**Statutes** (memorize these):
- **CTA 2009 s.14**: Company incorporated in UK = UK resident
- **CTA 2009 s.15**: Registration in UK (for foreign companies)
- **CTA 2009 s.18**: Double tax agreements override domestic law
- **TIOPA 2010**: Treaty provisions (Article 4 residence)

**Case Law** (know principles):
- **De Beers Consolidated Mines v Howe [1906]**: CMC = where real business carried on
- **Unit Construction v Bullock [1960]**: CMC = where control actually exercised
- **Untelrab Ltd v McGregor [1996]**: Ordinary residence for companies (now replaced by CMC)
- **Wood v Holden [2006]**: Directors must ACTUALLY exercise control, not rubber-stamp
- **Development Securities [1971]**: Real vs nominal control

**Treaty Articles** (OECD Model):
- **Article 4(1)**: Definition of resident (person liable to tax by reason of domicile, residence, POEM)
- **Article 4(3)**: Dual resident companies - tie-breaker using POEM
- **Article 25**: Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) if competent authorities cannot agree

## 2.1.2 Individual Residence - Statutory Residence Test (SRT)

### Pattern Recognition: Spotting This Question Type

**Immediate Triggers** (if you see these words, deploy this template):
- "Individual," "days in UK," "Statutory Residence Test," "SRT"
- "Family tie," "accommodation tie," "work tie," "90-day tie," "country tie"
- "Automatic overseas test," "automatic UK test," "sufficient ties test"
- "Split year treatment," "leaver," "arriver"
- Day counting scenarios with multiple countries
- References to spouse/children residence status

**Exam Frequency**: **100% (8/8 exams from 2020-2025)** 🎯

**Recent Exam Appearances**:
- **June 2025 Q1**: Daniel Door (complex SRT with medical emergency, 2 ties, TNR)
- December 2024: (Individual residence question)
- June 2024: (Individual residence question)
- **Pattern**: GUARANTEED to appear in every exam

**Mark Range**: **15-25 marks** (often the highest-scoring Part A question)

---

### Strategic Context

**Why This Is THE Most Important Template:**

✓ Appears in **100% of exams** - you WILL face this question
✓ Highest mark allocation (typically 15-25 marks)
✓ Extremely formula-driven - easiest marks if you know the template
✓ Examiner reports show this is where candidates lose most marks through:
  - Incorrect day counting
  - Missing ties
  - Not applying all three tests in correct order
  - Forgetting split year treatment

**Time Allocation Strategy:**
- **Standalone SRT analysis**: 25-30 minutes
- **Integrated with treaty tie-breaker**: Add 8-10 minutes  
- **Integrated with TNR**: Add 5-8 minutes
- **Total for typical Part A question**: 30-40 minutes

**Difficulty vs. Return Assessment:**
- **Difficulty**: Medium-High (lots of moving parts, easy to make errors)
- **Return**: VERY HIGH (18-22 marks achievable with template)
- **Efficiency Gain**: Master this template = pass the exam (not exaggerating!)

### The SRT: Hierarchical Three-Test Structure

**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING**: The SRT has **3 tests** that must be applied in **strict order**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TEST 1: AUTOMATIC OVERSEAS TEST                            │
│  If ANY test passed → STOP → Individual is NON-UK resident  │
│  • 3 sub-tests (46-day, 16-day, full-time work abroad)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↓ If no test passed
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TEST 2: AUTOMATIC UK RESIDENCE TEST                         │
│  If ANY test passed → STOP → Individual is UK resident      │
│  • 3 sub-tests (183-day, only home, full-time work UK)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↓ If no test passed
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TEST 3: SUFFICIENT TIES TEST                                │
│  Count ties + UK days → determine residence                 │
│  • 5 possible ties (family, accommodation, work, 90-day,    │
│    country)                                                  │
│  • Different thresholds for "arrivers" vs "leavers"        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Golden Rule**: Always apply in this order. Never skip to Sufficient Ties Test without checking Automatic tests first!

---

### Execution Framework

**PHASE 1: Preparation (5 minutes)**

```
STEP 1: Count Days in UK (2 min)
• Only count days present in UK at midnight
• EXCLUDE: Days in transit, exceptional circumstances (very limited)
• INCLUDE: Days in hospital if deliberate choice to come to UK
• Create simple table showing breakdown by month/country
• Check for split year treatment eligibility

STEP 2: Identify Individual's Status (1 min)
• "Arriver" = non-resident in ALL of previous 3 tax years
• "Leaver" = resident in 1 or MORE of previous 3 tax years
• This determines which Sufficient Ties thresholds apply

STEP 3: Note Family Facts (2 min)
• Spouse/civil partner residence status
• Minor children residence status
• Where accommodation is available
• Work patterns (>3 hours on X days)
• Previous year UK days
```

**PHASE 2: Apply the Three Tests (15-20 minutes)**

**TEST 1: AUTOMATIC OVERSEAS TEST** (3 minutes)

Apply each sub-test in turn:

**Sub-Test A: Non-resident in all of previous 3 years + <46 UK days**
```
IF (non-resident 3 prior years) AND (UK days < 46)
THEN → Automatically NON-UK resident → STOP
```

**Sub-Test B: Resident in 1+ of previous 3 years + <16 UK days**
```
IF (resident in 1+ prior years) AND (UK days < 16)  
THEN → Automatically NON-UK resident → STOP
```

**Sub-Test C: Full-time work abroad + <91 UK days + <31 UK work days**
```
IF (work abroad full-time) AND (UK days < 91) AND (UK work days < 31)
THEN → Automatically NON-UK resident → STOP

Full-time work = average 35+ hours/week over period
UK work day = work >3 hours in UK on that day
```

**If NONE of the Automatic Overseas tests are met → proceed to Test 2**

---

**TEST 2: AUTOMATIC UK RESIDENCE TEST** (3 minutes)

Apply each sub-test in turn:

**Sub-Test A: 183+ days in UK**
```
IF UK days ≥ 183
THEN → Automatically UK resident → STOP
```

**Sub-Test B: Only home in UK**
```
IF (has home in UK for 91+ days) AND (present in UK home on 30+ days)
   AND (no overseas home OR overseas home <30 days)
THEN → Automatically UK resident → STOP

"Home" = building/vessel available for 91+ days continuously
Present = spend time there on separate days (not nights)
```

**Sub-Test C: Full-time work in UK**
```
IF (work in UK full-time over 365-day period) 
   AND (more than 75% of work days are UK work days)
   AND (at least 1 UK work day in tax year)
THEN → Automatically UK resident → STOP

Full-time = average 35+ hours/week
UK work day = work >3 hours in UK on that day
```

**If NONE of the Automatic UK tests are met → proceed to Test 3**

---

**TEST 3: SUFFICIENT TIES TEST** (10-15 minutes)

**STEP 1: Identify All Ties (8 minutes)**

Work through each tie systematically:

**TIE 1: FAMILY TIE** ✓ / ✗
```
Condition: Spouse/civil partner OR minor children are UK resident

Key points:
• Spouse must be UK resident in their OWN right under SRT
  (not just because individual is resident!)
• Minor children = under 18 at START of tax year
• Children at boarding school = still count
• Separated/estranged spouse = no tie

Evidence needed from facts:
- Where does spouse/partner live?
- How many days does spouse spend in UK?
- Are there minor children? Where do they live/go to school?

→ TIE EXISTS if: _____ (explain based on facts)
```

**TIE 2: ACCOMMODATION TIE** ✓ / ✗
```
Condition: UK accommodation available for 91+ consecutive days AND
           individual present on 1+ nights in tax year

Types of accommodation:
• Owned or rented property
• Available for use (even if not used every day)
• Family/friend's property if available AND used on 16+ nights

Evidence needed from facts:
- Does individual own/rent UK property?
- Available for how long continuously?
- Did they stay there in the tax year?
- Any stays at family/friend homes?

→ TIE EXISTS if: _____ (explain based on facts)
```

**TIE 3: WORK TIE** ✓ / ✗
```
Condition: Works in UK on 40+ days (>3 hours per day)

Calculation:
• Count each day where individual works >3 hours in UK
• Includes employed and self-employed work
• Excludes: incidental work, < 3 hours

Evidence needed from facts:
- How many days worked in UK?
- Hours per day?
- Nature of work?

→ TIE EXISTS if: _____ (explain based on facts)
```

**TIE 4: 90-DAY TIE** ✓ / ✗
```
Condition: Spent >90 days in UK in EITHER of previous 2 tax years

Calculation:
• Look back at year before last (Y-2)
• Look back at last year (Y-1)
• If EITHER year had >90 UK days → tie exists

Evidence needed from facts:
- How many UK days in prior 2 years?
- Any mention of "previously spent X days in UK"?

→ TIE EXISTS if: _____ (explain based on facts)
```

**TIE 5: COUNTRY TIE** ✓ / ✗
```
Condition: Spends more days in UK than in any OTHER single country

Only applies to "leavers" (not arrivers)

Calculation:
• Count days in each country during tax year
• Compare UK days with highest other country
• If UK > any other single country → tie exists

Evidence needed from facts:
- Day breakdown by country?
- Which country had most days?

→ TIE EXISTS if: _____ (explain based on facts)
```

**STEP 2: Count Total Ties** (1 minute)

```
TOTAL TIES FOR [NAME]: ___ / 5

✓ Family Tie: Yes/No
✓ Accommodation Tie: Yes/No  
✓ Work Tie: Yes/No
✓ 90-Day Tie: Yes/No
✓ Country Tie: Yes/No (only for leavers)
```

**STEP 3: Apply Day/Tie Matrix** (2 minutes)

**For LEAVERS** (resident in 1+ of previous 3 years):

| UK Days | Ties Needed | Result |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| < 16 | Any | Non-resident (Automatic Overseas) |
| 16-45 | 4+ ties required | Check tie count |
| 46-90 | 3+ ties required | Check tie count |
| 91-120 | 2+ ties required | Check tie count |
| 121-182 | 1+ tie required | Check tie count |
| 183+ | Any | UK resident (Automatic UK) |

**For ARRIVERS** (non-resident in all previous 3 years):

| UK Days | Ties Needed | Result |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| < 46 | Any | Non-resident (Automatic Overseas) |
| 46-90 | 4+ ties required | Check tie count |
| 91-120 | 3+ ties required | Check tie count |
| 121-182 | 2+ ties required | Check tie count |
| 183+ | Any | UK resident (Automatic UK) |

**Application:**
```
[Name] is a [LEAVER / ARRIVER]
[Name] spent [X] days in UK in 202X/2X
[Name] has [Y] ties

Applying the matrix:
- Days in UK: [X] → Falls in bracket [16-45 / 46-90 / 91-120 / 121-182]
- Ties required for UK residence: [Z]
- Ties present: [Y]

CONCLUSION:
[If Y ≥ Z]: Individual IS UK resident (has sufficient ties)
[If Y < Z]: Individual is NOT UK resident (insufficient ties)
```

---

**PHASE 3: Additional Considerations** (5 minutes)

**Split Year Treatment**

If individual arrives in/leaves UK during tax year:
```
Check if split year applies:
• Case 1: Starts full-time work abroad
• Case 2: Partner starts full-time work abroad  
• Case 3: Ceases to have UK home
• Case 4: Starts to have UK home only
• Case 5: Starts full-time work in UK
• Case 6: Ceases full-time work abroad
• Case 7: Partner ceases full-time work abroad
• Case 8: Starts to have UK home

If split year applies:
- Part of year = UK resident
- Part of year = non-UK resident
- Specify which part is which
```

**Treaty Tie-Breaker** (if dual resident)

If UK resident under SRT AND resident under another country's domestic law:
```
Apply OECD Model Article 4(2) tie-breaker (for individuals):

1. Permanent home test
   → Where is individual's permanent home available?
   
2. Centre of vital interests (if homes in both)
   → Where are personal/economic ties closer?
   
3. Habitual abode (if unclear)
   → Where does individual habitually live?
   
4. Nationality
   → Which country's citizenship held?

Conclusion: Treaty residence is in [Country]
```

[If FAILED]: [Name] is not automatically UK resident.
→ PROCEED TO SUFFICIENT TIES TEST

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PART C: SUFFICIENT TIES TEST

[Only complete if both Automatic tests failed]

Under FA 2013 Sch 45 Part 4, residence is determined by the number
of "ties" to the UK combined with days spent in the UK.

STEP 1: IDENTIFY TIES

TIE 1: FAMILY TIE

Conditions:
• Spouse/civil partner is UK resident (under SRT), OR
• Minor children (<18 at start of tax year) are UK resident

Analysis of facts:

Spouse/Partner: [Name]
- Days in UK 202X/2X: [X] days
- Residence status under SRT: [Describe - is spouse UK resident?]
- Family tie conclusion: [Yes, spouse is UK resident / No]

Minor Children:
- Number of minor children: [X]
- Where resident: [UK / Overseas / Mix]
- Days in UK: [Describe]
- Family tie conclusion: [Yes, children UK resident / No]

→ FAMILY TIE: [EXISTS / DOES NOT EXIST]

Reasoning: [Explain based on facts]

---

TIE 2: ACCOMMODATION TIE  

Conditions:
• UK accommodation available for 91+ consecutive days in tax year, AND
• Individual present in accommodation on 1+ nights in tax year
• (OR) Family/friend accommodation used 16+ nights

Analysis of facts:

UK Property Owned/Rented:
- Address/type: [Describe]
- Available for: [X] days continuously
- Individual present: [Y] nights in tax year

Family/Friend Accommodation:
- Any stays at family/friend homes: [Yes/No]
- If yes, total nights: [Z]

→ ACCOMMODATION TIE: [EXISTS / DOES NOT EXIST]

Reasoning: [Explain based on facts]

---

TIE 3: WORK TIE

Condition:
• Works in UK >3 hours on 40+ days in tax year

Analysis of facts:

UK Work Pattern:
- Nature of work: [Describe]
- Days worked >3 hours in UK: [X] days
- Threshold: 40 days

→ WORK TIE: [EXISTS / DOES NOT EXIST]

Reasoning: [Explain based on facts]

---

TIE 4: 90-DAY TIE

Condition:
• Spent >90 days in UK in EITHER of the 2 preceding tax years

Analysis of facts:

Tax year 202X-2/2X-1: [X] UK days [>90 / ≤90]
Tax year 202X-1/2X: [Y] UK days [>90 / ≤90]

→ 90-DAY TIE: [EXISTS / DOES NOT EXIST]

Reasoning: [Explain based on facts]

---

TIE 5: COUNTRY TIE (only applies to "leavers")

[Skip this section if individual is an "arriver"]

Condition:
• Spends more days in UK than in any other single country

Analysis of facts:

Days by country in 202X/2X:
UK:            [X] days
[Country Y]:   [Y] days
[Country Z]:   [Z] days
[Other]:       [W] days

Highest non-UK country: [Country Y] with [Y] days
UK days: [X]

Comparison: UK days [greater than / less than / equal to] [Country Y]

→ COUNTRY TIE: [EXISTS / DOES NOT EXIST]

Reasoning: [Explain based on facts]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 2: COUNT TIES

TOTAL TIES FOR [NAME]: [X] / [4 or 5]

Summary:
✓ Family Tie:         [YES / NO]
✓ Accommodation Tie:  [YES / NO]
✓ Work Tie:           [YES / NO]
✓ 90-Day Tie:         [YES / NO]
✓ Country Tie:        [YES / NO - or N/A if arriver]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 3: APPLY SUFFICIENT TIES MATRIX

[Name] is a [LEAVER / ARRIVER]
[Name] spent [X] days in UK
[Name] has [Y] ties to UK

Applicable Matrix:

[If LEAVER - use this table]:

| UK Days     | Ties Required | [Name's Position]        |
|-------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| < 16        | Any           | Automatic overseas       |
| 16 - 45     | 4+ ties       | [X] days, [Y] ties      |
| 46 - 90     | 3+ ties       | [X] days, [Y] ties      |
| 91 - 120    | 2+ ties       | [X] days, [Y] ties      |
| 121 - 182   | 1+ tie        | [X] days, [Y] ties      |
| 183+        | Any           | Automatic UK             |

[If ARRIVER - use this table]:

| UK Days     | Ties Required | [Name's Position]        |
|-------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| < 46        | Any           | Automatic overseas       |
| 46 - 90     | 4+ ties       | [X] days, [Y] ties      |
| 91 - 120    | 3+ ties       | [X] days, [Y] ties      |
| 121 - 182   | 2+ ties       | [X] days, [Y] ties      |
| 183+        | Any           | Automatic UK             |

Application:

Days in UK: [X] → Falls in bracket [[16-45] / [46-90] / [91-120] / [121-182]]
Ties required for UK residence: [Z]+
Ties present: [Y]

Comparison: [Y] ties [IS ≥ / IS < ] [Z] ties required

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FINAL CONCLUSION

Based on the Statutory Residence Test analysis:

[Name] [IS / IS NOT] UK tax resident for tax year 202X/2X.

Basis of determination:
[Automatic Overseas Test / Automatic UK Test / Sufficient Ties Test]

Reasoning:
[Provide 2-3 sentence summary of key facts leading to conclusion]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

[Include these sections if relevant to facts]:

1. SPLIT YEAR TREATMENT

[If individual arrives/leaves during year, check split year cases]

Applicable split year case: [Case 1-8 or None]

If split year applies:
- UK resident part: [Date range]
- Non-UK resident part: [Date range]

2. TREATY TIE-BREAKER (If dual resident under domestic laws)

[If both UK SRT and foreign country determine residence, apply treaty]

Article 4(2) OECD Model tie-breaker:
1. Permanent home: [Analysis]
2. Centre of vital interests: [Analysis]
3. Habitual abode: [Analysis]
4. Nationality: [Analysis]

Treaty residence conclusion: [Country]

3. CONSEQUENCES OF RESIDENCE STATUS

As a [UK resident / non-UK resident] for 202X/2X:

[If UK resident]:
• Liable to UK tax on worldwide income and gains
• [If also non-domiciled: may claim remittance basis]
• Filing obligations: Self Assessment tax return
• [Other specific consequences based on facts]

[If non-UK resident]:
• Liable to UK tax only on UK source income
• UK residential property gains remain taxable
• [Check temporary non-residence rules if left UK recently]
• [Other specific consequences based on facts]

### Worked Example: June 2025 Question 1, Part 1 (Daniel Door)

**QUESTION FACTS** (from June 2025 exam):

*Daniel Door, a British citizen, has been UK resident for many years. On 1 April 2023, he moved to Spain with his Spanish partner Frederica. During the 2024/25 tax year:*

- *Spain: 95 days (at Spanish home) + 35 days (other) = 130 days total*
- *UK: 70 days + 28 days (hospital in February for medical treatment) = 98 days total*
- *Italy: 40 days*
- *Other countries: 97 days*
- *Daniel made a deliberate choice for family reasons to be treated in the UK for his medical emergency*
- *Frederica is UK resident (works >3 hours on 45 days in UK, spent 92 days in UK in 2022/23)*
- *Daniel has no minor children*
- *Daniel owns a UK home but did not stay there in 2024/25 (stayed in hotels when visiting UK)*
- *Daniel worked >3 hours in UK on only 5 occasions*
- *Daniel spent 92 days in UK in 2022/23*

**EXAMINER REQUIREMENT**: "Determine whether Daniel is UK resident for 2024/25."

**TIME ALLOCATION**: 25 minutes

**ANSWER** (using Template B):

---

**INDIVIDUAL RESIDENCE ANALYSIS - STATUTORY RESIDENCE TEST**

**Tax Year**: 2024/25  
**Individual**: Daniel Door

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**PRELIMINARY MATTERS**

**1. DAY COUNT**

Days in UK during 2024/25 tax year: **98 days**

Breakdown:
- Regular UK visits: 70 days
- Hospital stay (February 2025): 28 days
- **TOTAL**: 98 days

*Note on hospital days*: Daniel made a deliberate choice for family reasons to be treated in the UK. His hospital stay is therefore **unlikely to qualify for the exceptional circumstances exception**. These 28 days count toward his UK day total.

[Annotation: ✓ Examiners look for you to spot this - deliberate choice = days count. Worth 2 marks.]

**2. ARRIVER vs LEAVER STATUS**

Tax year 2021/22: UK resident (stated "always been UK resident" until 1 April 2023)  
Tax year 2022/23: UK resident  
Tax year 2023/24: Non-UK resident (moved to Spain 1 April 2023)

**Conclusion**: Daniel is a **LEAVER** for 2024/25

*Reasoning*: A "leaver" is an individual who was UK resident in 1 or more of the previous 3 tax years. Daniel was resident in 2021/22 and 2022/23, so meets this definition.

[Annotation: ✓ Critical determination - leavers face stricter day/tie thresholds. Worth 2-3 marks.]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**PART A: AUTOMATIC OVERSEAS TEST**

Under FA 2013 Sch 45 Part 2, Daniel is automatically NON-UK resident if ANY of the following tests are met:

**Test 1: Non-resident in all previous 3 years + <46 UK days**

Daniel **was resident** in 1 or more of the previous 3 years (2021/22 and 2022/23).

→ **Test 1: FAILED** - does not meet "non-resident in all previous 3 years" condition

[Annotation: ✓ Always state why test fails, not just conclusion. Worth 1 mark.]

---

**Test 2: Resident in 1+ previous 3 years + <16 UK days**

Daniel **was resident** in 1 or more of the previous 3 tax years (2021/22, 2022/23).  
Daniel spent **98 days** in UK, which **exceeds** 16 days.

→ **Test 2: FAILED** - 98 days > 16 day threshold

---

**Test 3: Full-time work abroad + <91 UK days + <31 UK work days**

Full-time work abroad requires average 35+ hours per week over the period.

Daniel's work pattern: The question states Daniel "does no work for more than half the year." This means Daniel cannot meet the full-time work abroad requirement.

→ **Test 3: FAILED** - Daniel does not work full-time abroad

[Annotation: ✓ Picking up this fact from the question shows careful reading. Worth 2 marks.]

---

**CONCLUSION ON AUTOMATIC OVERSEAS TEST:**

Daniel **FAILED** the Automatic Overseas Test (none of the 3 sub-tests passed).

→ **PROCEED TO AUTOMATIC UK RESIDENCE TEST**

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**PART B: AUTOMATIC UK RESIDENCE TEST**

Under FA 2013 Sch 45 Part 3, Daniel is automatically UK resident if ANY of the following tests are met:

**Test 1: 183+ days in UK**

Daniel spent **98 days** in UK in 2024/25.

98 < 183

→ **Test 1: FAILED** - below 183 day threshold

[Annotation: ✓ This is the most straightforward test. Worth 1-2 marks.]

---

**Test 2: Only home in UK**

"Home" test requirements:
- Individual has home in UK available for 91+ consecutive days
- Individual present in UK home on 30+ separate days in tax year
- Individual has NO overseas home OR overseas home <30 days present

Daniel's homes:
- **UK home**: Yes - Daniel owns a UK home (available all year = 365 days)
- **Present in UK home**: **0 days** - "does not spend any time in his UK home during 2024/25" (stayed in hotels)
- **Overseas homes**: Yes - Daniel has homes in Spain and several other countries

Analysis:

Even though Daniel has a UK home available for 91+ days, he was **not present in it for at least 30 days** in the tax year. The test requires BOTH conditions to be met.

Additionally, Daniel has overseas homes where he is present.

→ **Test 2: FAILED** - only home test not satisfied

[Annotation: ✓ Common trap - students forget the "present 30 days" requirement. Spotting this worth 2-3 marks.]

---

**Test 3: Full-time work in UK**

Full-time work in UK requires:
- Work in UK throughout 365-day period
- Average 35+ hours per week
- >75% of work days are UK work days
- At least 1 UK work day in tax year

Daniel's work pattern in UK:

Daniel "only works in the UK, for more than 3 hours on **5 occasions**."

5 occasions is far below the threshold for full-time work (which would require working substantially throughout the year with >75% of work days in UK).

→ **Test 3: FAILED** - Daniel does not work full-time in UK

---

**CONCLUSION ON AUTOMATIC UK RESIDENCE TEST:**

Daniel **FAILED** the Automatic UK Residence Test (none of the 3 sub-tests passed).

→ **PROCEED TO SUFFICIENT TIES TEST**

[Annotation: ✓ This is the typical pattern - most complex SRT questions land in Sufficient Ties Test. Worth noting you've systematically ruled out automatic tests. Worth 2 marks for clear structure.]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**PART C: SUFFICIENT TIES TEST**

Under FA 2013 Sch 45 Part 4, residence is determined by the number of "ties" to the UK combined with days spent in the UK.

**STEP 1: IDENTIFY TIES**

---

**TIE 1: FAMILY TIE**

Conditions:
- Spouse/civil partner is UK resident (under SRT), OR
- Minor children (<18 at start of tax year) are UK resident

Analysis of facts:

**Spouse/Partner**: Frederica (Daniel's Spanish partner)

Frederica's residence status for 2024/25:
- Days in UK 2024/25: 98 days (same as Daniel)
- Work in UK: >3 hours on **45 days** in 2024/25 → **Work tie exists**
- 90-day tie: Spent **92 days** in UK in 2022/23 → **90-day tie exists**
- Ties: 2 ties (work + 90-day)

Applying Sufficient Ties matrix for Frederica (she is also a leaver):
- 98 days in UK + 2 ties
- As a leaver with 91-120 days, she needs **2+ ties** for UK residence
- Frederica has exactly 2 ties
- **Frederica IS UK resident** for 2024/25

**Minor Children**: Daniel has **no minor children** (stated in facts).

→ **FAMILY TIE: EXISTS**

**Reasoning**: Frederica, Daniel's partner, is UK resident in her own right under the SRT (98 days + 2 ties). This creates a family tie for Daniel.

[Annotation: ✓✓ This is complex - you must work out Frederica's residence to determine Daniel's family tie. Shows high-level analysis. Worth 4-5 marks.]

---

**TIE 2: ACCOMMODATION TIE**

Conditions:
- UK accommodation available for 91+ consecutive days in tax year, AND
- Individual present in accommodation on 1+ nights in tax year
- (OR) Family/friend accommodation used 16+ nights

Analysis of facts:

**UK Property Owned/Rented**:
- Daniel owns a UK home
- Available for: 365 days continuously (all year)
- Individual present: **0 nights** - "does not spend any time in his UK home during 2024/25"

**Family/Friend Accommodation**:
- Daniel stays in **hotels** when he visits the UK
- No mention of stays at family/friend homes

→ **ACCOMMODATION TIE: DOES NOT EXIST**

**Reasoning**: Although Daniel has a UK home available for 91+ days, he did not spend **at least one night** in it during the tax year. The accommodation tie requires BOTH conditions. Hotel stays do not create an accommodation tie.

[Annotation: ✓ Another common trap - accommodation must be available AND used. Worth 2-3 marks.]

---

**TIE 3: WORK TIE**

Condition:
- Works in UK >3 hours on 40+ days in tax year

Analysis of facts:

Daniel "only worked in the UK for more than 3 hours on **5 occasions**."

5 days < 40 day threshold

→ **WORK TIE: DOES NOT EXIST**

**Reasoning**: Daniel worked >3 hours on only 5 days in UK, well below the 40-day threshold required.

[Annotation: ✓ Straightforward application. Worth 1-2 marks.]

---

**TIE 4: 90-DAY TIE**

Condition:
- Spent >90 days in UK in EITHER of the 2 preceding tax years

Analysis of facts:

Tax year 2022/23: **92 UK days** (stated in facts)  
Tax year 2023/24: Not stated, but Daniel moved to Spain 1 April 2023, so likely <90 days

At least ONE of the previous two years (2022/23) had **>90 days**.

→ **90-DAY TIE: EXISTS**

**Reasoning**: Daniel spent 92 days in UK in 2022/23, which exceeds 90 days. This is sufficient - only ONE of the previous two years needs to exceed 90 days.

[Annotation: ✓ Important - you don't need BOTH years >90 days, just one. Worth 2 marks.]

---

**TIE 5: COUNTRY TIE** (only applies to "leavers")

Condition:
- Spends more days in UK than in any other single country

Analysis of facts:

Days by country in 2024/25:
- **Spain**: 130 days (95 at Spanish home + 35 other)
- **UK**: 98 days
- **Italy**: 40 days
- **Other countries**: 97 days (but split across multiple countries)

Highest single country: **Spain with 130 days**  
UK days: **98 days**

Comparison: UK days (98) **LESS THAN** Spain days (130)

→ **COUNTRY TIE: DOES NOT EXIST**

**Reasoning**: Daniel spent more days in Spain (130) than in the UK (98) during 2024/25. The country tie only exists if UK days exceed ALL other countries. Spain is the single country with most days.

[Annotation: ✓ Critical calculation - must identify the highest OTHER country. Worth 2-3 marks.]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**STEP 2: COUNT TIES**

**TOTAL TIES FOR DANIEL**: **2 / 5**

Summary:
- ✓ **Family Tie**: **YES** (Frederica is UK resident)
- ✗ **Accommodation Tie**: **NO** (UK home not used)
- ✗ **Work Tie**: **NO** (only 5 UK work days)
- ✓ **90-Day Tie**: **YES** (92 days in 2022/23)
- ✗ **Country Tie**: **NO** (more days in Spain)

[Annotation: ✓ Clear summary helps examiner mark quickly. Worth 1 mark for presentation.]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**STEP 3: APPLY SUFFICIENT TIES MATRIX**

Daniel is a **LEAVER** (resident in 1+ of previous 3 years)  
Daniel spent **98 days** in UK  
Daniel has **2 ties** to UK

**Applicable Matrix for LEAVERS**:

| UK Days     | Ties Required | Daniel's Position        |
|-------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| < 16        | Any           | Automatic overseas       |
| 16 - 45     | 4+ ties       | -                        |
| 46 - 90     | 3+ ties       | -                        |
| **91 - 120**    | **2+ ties**       | **98 days, 2 ties ✓**   |
| 121 - 182   | 1+ tie        | -                        |
| 183+        | Any           | Automatic UK             |

**Application**:

Days in UK: **98** → Falls in bracket **[91-120]**  
Ties required for UK residence: **2+**  
Ties present: **2**

Comparison: **2 ties = 2 ties required**

Daniel has **exactly the number of ties required** for UK residence in the 91-120 day bracket.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**FINAL CONCLUSION**

Based on the Statutory Residence Test analysis:

**Daniel Door IS UK tax resident for tax year 2024/25.**

**Basis of determination**: Sufficient Ties Test

**Reasoning**: 

As a leaver who spent 98 days in the UK (falling in the 91-120 day bracket), Daniel requires 2 or more ties to be UK resident. Daniel has exactly 2 ties:
1. **Family tie** (partner Frederica is UK resident)
2. **90-day tie** (spent 92 days in UK in 2022/23)

Based on having 2 ties and 98 UK days, Daniel **exceeds the threshold** for UK residence under the Sufficient Ties Test and is therefore UK resident for 2024/25.

[Annotation: ✓✓ Clear, definitive conclusion citing the specific test and reasoning. Essential for full marks. Worth 3-4 marks.]

**MARK ALLOCATION** (Estimated based on June 2025 suggested solutions):

| Element | Marks |
|---------|-------|
| Day count (including hospital analysis) | 2-3 |
| Arriver/Leaver determination | 2 |
| Automatic Overseas Test (all 3 sub-tests) | 3-4 |
| Automatic UK Test (all 3 sub-tests) | 3-4 |
| Family tie (including Frederica's residence analysis) | 4-5 |
| Other ties analysis (4 ties) | 4-5 |
| Sufficient Ties matrix application | 2-3 |
| Final conclusion | 2-3 |
| **TOTAL** | **22-29/25** |

*Note: Total exceeds 25 because examiners use positive marking - you can score maximum marks even if you don't cover every single point.*

**Time Taken**: Approximately 25-28 minutes for this level of answer

---

**KEY LEARNING POINTS from this example**:

1. ✓ **Deliberate choice hospital days COUNT** - not exceptional circumstances
2. ✓ **Must determine spouse's residence first** before concluding on family tie
3. ✓ **Accommodation tie requires BOTH available AND used** - common trap
4. ✓ **90-day tie looks at EITHER of previous 2 years** - not both
5. ✓ **Country tie compares UK with HIGHEST single other country**
6. ✓ **Work systematically through ALL tests** - don't skip to Sufficient Ties
7. ✓ **Show your workings** - examiners award marks for method even if conclusion wrong

### Error Prevention: Top 10 Mistakes (SRT)

**MISTAKE #1**: "Counting hospital days as 'exceptional circumstances' when deliberate choice"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Hospital stay doesn't count because medical emergency"
- ✅ **Correct**: "Deliberate choice to come to UK for treatment = days count"
- **Test**: Was it a deliberate choice? If YES → days count
- **Prevention**: Read facts carefully - "elected," "chose," "decided" = deliberate

**MISTAKE #2**: "Skipping Automatic tests and jumping straight to Sufficient Ties"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Counting ties without checking 183-day test first
- ✅ **Correct**: ALWAYS apply tests in order: Automatic Overseas → Automatic UK → Sufficient Ties
- **Why critical**: You can miss easy conclusions (e.g., 183+ days = automatic UK resident)
- **Time saving**: Automatic tests take 3 minutes total, save 15 minutes if they apply

**MISTAKE #3**: "Forgetting to determine spouse's residence before concluding on family tie"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Spouse lives in UK → family tie exists"
- ✅ **Correct**: "Spouse is UK resident UNDER THE SRT → family tie exists"
- **Critical point**: Must analyze spouse's residence through SRT - living in UK ≠ UK resident
- **Common in exams**: June 2025 tested this - Frederica needed full SRT analysis

**MISTAKE #4**: "Counting accommodation tie when home not used"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Has UK home available → accommodation tie"
- ✅ **Correct**: "Has UK home available for 91+ days AND present 1+ nights → accommodation tie"
- **Both conditions required**: Available + Used
- **Classic trap**: Examiners love this - home available but individual stays in hotels

**MISTAKE #5**: "Confusing 90-day tie (needs ONE of previous 2 years >90)"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Spent 92 days in 2022/23 but only 50 days in 2023/24 → no 90-day tie"
- ✅ **Correct**: "Spent 92 days in 2022/23 → 90-day tie EXISTS (only need one year)"
- **Rule**: EITHER of the two preceding years >90 days is sufficient
- **Don't**: Add them together or require both years

**MISTAKE #6**: "Country tie calculation error - using total 'other' instead of single highest"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "UK 98 days, Other countries 167 days total → no country tie"
- ✅ **Correct**: "UK 98 days, Spain 130 days (highest single) → no country tie"
- **Key word**: "Single" country - compare UK with the ONE country with most days
- **Not**: Total of all other countries combined

**MISTAKE #7**: "Mixing up Arriver vs Leaver thresholds"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Applying arriver matrix when individual was resident last year
- ✅ **Correct**: Check residence history first → determine status → use correct matrix
- **Critical**: Leavers have STRICTER requirements (can be resident with fewer days)
- **Memorize**: Resident in 1+ of previous 3 years = Leaver

**MISTAKE #8**: "Not counting ALL relevant work days for work tie"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Works occasionally in UK → no work tie"
- ✅ **Correct**: Count every single day >3 hours, including travel days where work done
- **Threshold**: 40+ days (>3 hours each) = work tie
- **Include**: Employed work, self-employed, director duties, remote work while in UK

**MISTAKE #9**: "Concluding residence without stating which test applies"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Individual is UK resident." [Stop]
- ✅ **Correct**: "Individual is UK resident under the Sufficient Ties Test because..."
- **Examiner wants**: Explicit statement of which test led to conclusion
- **Marks**: Costs 2-3 marks if you don't specify the basis

**MISTAKE #10**: "Forgetting split year treatment in arrival/departure scenarios"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Analyzing full-year residence only when individual clearly arrived/left mid-year
- ✅ **Correct**: After determining year-residence, check if split year cases apply
- **Don't skip**: Even if question doesn't explicitly ask, flag split year possibility
- **Bonus marks**: Mentioning relevant split year case earns 2-3 professional marks

### Quick Reference: Key Legislation & Thresholds

**Primary Legislation** (memorize this):
- **FA 2013 Schedule 45**: Statutory Residence Test
  - Part 2: Automatic Overseas Test
  - Part 3: Automatic Resident Test  
  - Part 4: Sufficient Ties Test
  - Part 5: Split Year Treatment

---

**Day Counting Rules**:
- Count days present in UK **at midnight**
- EXCLUDE: Days in transit (< 4 hours), exceptional circumstances (very rare)
- INCLUDE: Arrival day (if present at midnight), departure day (if present at midnight)
- Hospital stays: Count UNLESS truly exceptional AND not deliberate choice

---

**Automatic Overseas Test** (if ANY passed → non-resident):
1. Non-resident all 3 prior years + **<46 days**
2. Resident 1+ prior years + **<16 days**
3. Full-time work abroad + **<91 days** + **<31 UK work days**

---

**Automatic UK Test** (if ANY passed → UK resident):
1. **≥183 days** in UK
2. Only home in UK (91+ days available, 30+ days present, no overseas home)
3. Full-time work in UK (365-day period, >75% UK work days)

---

**The Five Ties**:

| Tie | Condition | Key Facts Needed |
|-----|-----------|------------------|
| **Family** | Spouse/partner OR minor children UK resident | Spouse's days + ties; children's location |
| **Accommodation** | UK home 91+ days available AND 1+ night present | Property ownership; nights stayed |
| **Work** | Work >3 hours on **40+ days** in UK | Count every day >3 hours worked |
| **90-Day** | **>90 days** in UK in EITHER of 2 prior years | Prior year day counts |
| **Country** | More days in UK than any **single** other country | Day breakdown by country |

---

**Sufficient Ties Matrix - LEAVERS**:

| Days | 16-45 | 46-90 | 91-120 | 121-182 |
|------|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| Ties needed | 4+ | 3+ | **2+** | 1+ |

**Sufficient Ties Matrix - ARRIVERS**:

| Days | 46-90 | 91-120 | 121-182 |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| Ties needed | 4+ | 3+ | 2+ |

---

**Split Year Treatment - 8 Cases**:

**Leaving UK**:
- Case 1: Starting full-time work abroad
- Case 2: Partner starting full-time work abroad
- Case 3: Ceasing to have a home in UK

**Coming to UK**:
- Case 4: Starting to have a UK home only
- Case 5: Starting full-time work in UK
- Case 6: Ceasing full-time work abroad
- Case 7: Partner ceasing full-time work abroad
- Case 8: Starting to have a UK home

---

**Treaty Tie-Breaker (OECD Model Article 4(2))** - for individuals:

1. **Permanent home** → Where available?
2. **Centre of vital interests** (if homes in both) → Personal/economic ties closer where?
3. **Habitual abode** (if unclear) → Where habitually live?
4. **Nationality** → Which citizenship?

---

**Common Mark Allocation Patterns** (based on 2020-2025 exams):

- Day counting + exceptional circumstances: 2-3 marks
- Arriver/Leaver determination: 1-2 marks
- Automatic Overseas Test (all 3): 3-4 marks
- Automatic UK Test (all 3): 3-4 marks
- Five ties analysis: 6-8 marks (complex ties like family worth 3-4 marks each)
- Matrix application: 2-3 marks
- Conclusion: 2-3 marks
- Split year / treaty (if applicable): 3-5 marks

**Total for typical SRT question**: 20-25 marks

---

**Time Management Targets**:
- Day count + status determination: 3-5 minutes
- Automatic tests (both): 5-6 minutes
- Five ties analysis: 10-12 minutes
- Matrix application + conclusion: 3-4 minutes
- Split year / treaty (if needed): 5-8 minutes
- **TOTAL**: 26-35 minutes depending on complexity

---

**Pro Tips** for Exam Day:

1. ✓ Create a quick ties checklist on scrap paper at start (F/A/W/90/C)
2. ✓ Draw the day/tie matrix relevant to status (arriver/leaver) before analyzing
3. ✓ For complex spouse residence - do mini-SRT analysis in margin first
4. ✓ Always explicitly state which test led to your conclusion
5. ✓ If time running out - write conclusion even if analysis incomplete (3 marks)
