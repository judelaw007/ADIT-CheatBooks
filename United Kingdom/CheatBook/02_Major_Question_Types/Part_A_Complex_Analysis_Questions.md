# CHAPTER 02: MAJOR QUESTION TYPES

## PART A: Complex Analysis Questions (50 marks)

### Overview: The High-Stakes Backbone

Part A questions are the **heaviest weighted** section of the ADIT UK exam, accounting for **50 out of 100 marks** (50% of your total score). You must answer **BOTH questions** in Part A, with each worth 25 marks.

**Time Allocation**: You should spend approximately **90 minutes** (1.5 hours) on Part A—about **45 minutes per question** based on the 1.8 minutes-per-mark rule.

### Strategic Importance

From Chapter 01, you learned that certain topics appear with remarkable consistency:

| Topic | Frequency (2020-2025) | Strategic Priority |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Individual Residence (SRT)** | 100% (8/8 exams) | CRITICAL - GUARANTEED |
| **Domicile** | 88% (7/8 exams) | CRITICAL |
| **Remittance Basis** | 75% (6/8 exams) | CRITICAL |
| **Corporate Residence & PE** | 63% (5/8 exams) | HIGH |
| **Permanent Establishment** | 63% (5/8 exams) | HIGH |

**Key Insight**: If you master the templates in this chapter for Individual Residence, Corporate Residence/PE, and Remittance Basis, you will be prepared for approximately **75-80% of all Part A questions**.

### Part A Question Characteristics

**Common Features:**
- **Fact-dense scenarios** (200-400 words of facts)
- **Multi-jurisdictional** (typically involving 2-3 countries)
- **Multi-part requirements** (usually 2-4 sub-questions)
- **Integrated topics** (e.g., residence + treaty + temporary non-residence)
- **Recent legislative changes** (examiners love testing new rules)

**What Examiners Reward** (from Examiner Psychology):
1. **Structured analysis** - Clear headings and logical flow (10-15% of marks)
2. **Application to facts** - Linking rules to specific scenario details (40-45% of marks)
3. **Correct legislation citations** - FA 2013 Sch 45, s.809VA ITA 2007, etc. (10-15% of marks)
4. **Balanced conclusions** - "On balance..." or "Insufficient facts to determine conclusively..." (10-15% of marks)
5. **Professional skepticism** - Identifying risks and alternative interpretations (5-10% of marks)

**What Examiners Penalize:**
- ❌ Knowledge dumping without application to facts
- ❌ Ignoring specific facts provided in the question
- ❌ Failing to answer all parts of multi-part questions
- ❌ Generic statements without technical depth
- ❌ Poor structure making marking difficult

### Execution Priorities for Exam Day

**During Reading Time / First 10 Minutes:**

1. **Identify the topic instantly** (use pattern recognition guides below)
2. **Scan for legislation dates** (recent changes = high probability of being tested)
3. **Count the sub-parts** (ensure you allocate time to answer ALL parts)
4. **Flag facts requiring calculations** (day counts, tax computations, etc.)
5. **Choose your stronger question first** if both are unfamiliar

**During Answer Time:**

```
Minute 0-5:    Plan structure, identify template to use
Minute 5-35:   Execute template (write main answer)
Minute 35-40:  Add specific facts, calculations, legislation citations
Minute 40-43:  Conclusion and professional skepticism points
Minute 43-45:  Quality check (all parts answered? citations included?)
```

**Recovery Tactics:**
- If stuck on Part 1 of a question, move to Part 2 - don't lose marks you CAN earn
- If running out of time, switch to bullet points with legislation references
- Always provide a conclusion even if brief - easier marks than detailed analysis

## Template Matrix: Quick Selection Guide

Use this matrix to instantly identify which template to deploy:

| Question Trigger Words | Template to Use | Typical Marks | Time Allocation |
|------------------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| "Individual," "days in UK," "Statutory Residence Test," "SRT," "ties" | **2.1.2 Individual Residence** | 15-25 marks | 25-30 min |
| "Company," "incorporated," "central management and control," "board meetings," "dual resident" | **2.1.1 Corporate Residence** | 10-20 marks | 20-25 min |
| "Branch," "fixed place," "office," "agency," "conclude contracts," "preparatory or auxiliary" | **2.1.3 Permanent Establishment** | 10-20 marks | 15-20 min |
| "Non-domiciled," "remittance," "foreign income/gains," "arising basis," "RBC," "mixed funds" | **2.1.4 Remittance Basis** | 15-25 marks | 20-25 min |
| "Credit relief," "foreign tax," "double taxation," "temporary non-residence," "left UK," "returning to UK" | **2.1.5 DTR & TNR** | 5-15 marks | 15-20 min |
| "Double tax agreement," "treaty," "tie-breaker," "OECD Model," "Article 4," "POEM" | **2.1.1 + Treaty Overlay** | 5-10 marks | 10-12 min |

**Integration Alert**: Part A questions often **combine** multiple templates. For example:
- Individual Residence (2.1.2) + Treaty Tie-Breaker (2.1.1) + TNR (2.1.5) = 25 marks
- Corporate Residence (2.1.1) + PE (2.1.3) + WHT/Dividends = 25 marks

## 2.1.1 Corporate Residence & Treaty Tie-Breaker

### Pattern Recognition: Spotting This Question Type

**Immediate Triggers** (if you see these words, deploy this template):
- "Company," "incorporated," "Ltd," "SA," "Inc," "GmbH," "Plc"
- "Board meetings," "directors," "central management and control"
- "Strategic decisions," "place of effective management"
- "Dual resident," "treaty tie-breaker," "Article 4"
- "Incorporated in [Country X] but managed from [Country Y]"

**Recent Exam Appearances**:
- June 2025 Q2: Solaris Future SA (Spain incorporation, UK board meetings potential)
- December 2024: (check pattern)
- June 2024: (check pattern)
-Frequency: **63% (5/8 exams 2020-2025)**

**Mark Range**: Typically **10-20 marks** when tested

---

### Strategic Context

**Why This Matters:**
- Corporate residence determines **worldwide tax liability scope**
- Dual residence creates **severe double taxation risk** (no treaty protection)
- UK uses **Central Management and Control (CMC)** test (case law-based)
- Treaties use **Place of Effective Management (POEM)** tie-breaker (OECD Model Article 4)
- **NEW RISK**: Examiners increasingly test scenarios where incorporation ≠ management location

**Time Allocation Strategy:**
- **Standalone corporate residence question**: 15-20 minutes
- **Integrated with PE/dividends/unallowable purpose**: Add 10-15 minutes
- **Treaty tie-breaker analysis**: Add 8-10 minutes

**Difficulty vs. Return Assessment:**
- **Difficulty**: Medium (requires knowledge of case law + treaty)
- **Return**: High (marks come easily if you structure correctly)
- **Efficiency Gain**: Use the template structure below = save 5-7 minutes

### Template & Tools

**TEMPLATE A: Corporate Residence Analysis**

```
CORPORATE RESIDENCE ANALYSIS: [Company Name]

1. INCORPORATION TEST (CTA 2009 s.14)
   
   [Company Name] is incorporated in [Country].
   
   [If UK]: Under s.14 CTA 2009, a company incorporated in the UK is 
   conclusively UK tax resident, regardless of where management is located.
   Therefore, [Company] is UK resident.
   
   [If Foreign]: Under s.14 CTA 2009, [Company] is not UK resident by 
   incorporation. Must consider Central Management and Control test.

2. CENTRAL MANAGEMENT & CONTROL TEST (De Beers Case Law)
   
   Under UK case law (De Beers Consolidated Mines v Howe [1906]), a company  
   is resident where its "real business is carried on," determined by where
   central management and control is located.
   
   Central management and control is located where:
   • Strategic decisions are made ✓/✗
   • Board meetings are held ✓/✗  
   • Directors exercise control ✓/✗
   
   Analysis of facts:
   
   Board Meetings: [State where held, how often, what decisions made]
   → [Fact]: ___________________________________________
   
   Strategic Decisions: [Identify where key decisions are ACTUALLY made]
   → [Fact]: ___________________________________________
   
   Directors' Location: [Note residence of directors, particularly chairman]
   → [Fact]: ___________________________________________
   
   Conclusion: Central management and control is located in [Country] 
   because [reason]. Therefore, [Company] is [Country] tax resident under
   the CMC test.

3. DUAL RESIDENCE ASSESSMENT
   
   [Company] appears to be tax resident in:
   • [Country 1] under [incorporation / CMC / domestic law]
   • [Country 2] under [incorporation / CMC / domestic law]
   
   [If dual resident]: This creates dual residence, which means:
   ⚠️ WARNING: Dual resident companies are excluded from treaty protection
   under most UK DTAs. This creates severe double taxation risk as both
   countries can tax worldwide profits with no relief mechanism.
   
   [If NOT dual resident]: No dual residence issue. Proceed to treaty 
   tie-breaker if both countries claim residence under domestic law.

4. TREATY TIE-BREAKER (If Applicable - OECD Model Article 4(3))
   
   If both [Country A] and [Country B] consider [Company] resident under
   their respective domestic laws, the treaty tie-breaker applies.
   
   Under Article 4(3) of the [Country A]-[Country B] DTA (which follows
   OECD Model), a dual resident company is deemed resident solely in the
   country where its "place of effective management" (POEM) is located.
   
   POEM is where key management and commercial decisions necessary for
   conducting the company's business are made.
   
   Factors indicating POEM location:
   • Where do directors meet? → [Answer with facts]
   • Where are strategic decisions implemented? → [Answer]
   • Where are senior executives located? → [Answer]  
   • Where are key business functions performed? → [Answer]
   
   Conclusion: The POEM is located in [Country] because [reasons based on
   facts]. Therefore, [Company] is treaty resident in [Country] only.
   
   [If unclear]: Insufficient facts to conclusively determine POEM. The
   competent authorities of [Country A] and [Country B] would need to 
   reach agreement via Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) under Article 25
   of the DTA.

5. TAX CONSEQUENCES
   
   As a [Country] tax resident company, [Company] is liable to:
   • [Country] corporation tax on worldwide profits
   • [List specific obligations: filing, payments, etc.]
   • [Note any PE risks in other jurisdictions]
   
6. RECOMMENDATIONS
   
   [If dual residence risk]: Urgently restructure to ensure clear single
   residence. Options include:
   • Relocating board meetings exclusively to one jurisdiction
   • Ensuring strategic decisions made only in [jurisdiction]
   • [Other substance-based recommendations]
   
   [If CMC creates unintended UK residence]: Consider:
   • Relocating directors / board meetings
   • Ensuring UK directors are minority / non-executive
   • Using technology for remote board participation from [home country]
```

### Worked Example: June 2025 Question 2 (Extract)

**QUESTION FACTS** (Simplified - see full question in past papers):

*Solaris Future SA is a solar panel manufacturing company, incorporated and tax resident in Spain. Under Option 2, Solaris UK Ltd will be incorporated in the UK. The board of Solaris UK Ltd will include both UK and Spanish-resident directors, but all board meetings will take place in London.*

**EXAMINER REQUIREMENT**: "The UK corporate tax implications of Option 2."

**TEMPLATE APPLICATION** (with annotations):

---

**ANSWER** (using Template A above):

**CORPORATE RESIDENCE ANALYSIS: Solaris UK Ltd (Option 2)**

**1. INCORPORATION TEST (CTA 2009 s.14)**

Solaris UK Ltd will be incorporated in the United Kingdom.

Under s.14 CTA 2009, a company incorporated in the UK is conclusively UK tax resident, regardless of where its management and control is located. Therefore, **Solaris UK Ltd will be UK tax resident by virtue of incorporation**.

[Annotation: ✓ Quick win - 1-2 marks for citing correct statute and applying to facts]

**2. CENTRAL MANAGEMENT & CONTROL TEST** 

For completeness, I also consider the Central Management and Control (CMC) test, which is based on case law (De Beers Consolidated Mines v Howe [1906]).

Analysis of facts:

**Board Meetings**: All board meetings of Solaris UK Ltd will take place in London (UK).

**Directors' Location**: The board includes both UK-resident and Spanish-resident directors.

**Strategic Decisions**: There is no indication that strategic decisions affecting Solaris UK Ltd are made outside the UK. All decisions appear to be made in London at board meetings.

**Conclusion**: Central management and control of Solaris UK Ltd is located in the UK. This confirms UK tax residence (though this is already conclusive under the incorporation test).

[Annotation: ✓ Shows thoroughness - examiners like seeing both tests even if one is conclusive. Adds 2-3 marks.]

**3. PLACE OF EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT (POEM)**

The question refers to Spanish tax residence. If Spain also considers Solaris UK Ltd tax resident under Spanish domestic law (which is unlikely given UK incorporation and London management), then the POEM test under Article 4(3) of the OECD Model DTA would apply.

However, based on the facts:
- The company is incorporated in the UK
- All board meetings are in London  
- Both central management and control AND place of effective management are clearly in the UK

Therefore, there is no risk of dual residence. The DTA tie-breaker is not required. Solaris UK Ltd is solely UK tax resident.

[Annotation: ✓ Professional skepticism - addressing potential treaty issue even though unlikely. Shows examiner you've thought about all angles. Worth 1-2 marks.]

**4. TAX CONSEQUENCES**

As a UK tax resident company, Solaris UK Ltd will be liable to:

✓ **UK Corporation Tax** on its worldwide profits (s.5 CTA 2009)
✓ **Filing obligations**: Annual CT600 corporate tax return
✓ **Transfer pricing compliance**: All transactions with related parties (Solaris Future SA) must be at arm's length (TIOPA 2010 Part 4)
✓ **Quarterly installment payments**: If profits exceed £1.5m (large company threshold)

[Annotation: ✓ Specific consequences = strong application. Worth 4-5 marks in this type of question.]

**5. RISK: DUAL RESIDENCE OF PARENT (Solaris Future SA)**

⚠️ **IMPORTANT RISK**: The question states some board meetings of Solaris Future SA (the Spanish parent) will be held in the UK.

If strategic decisions for Solaris Future SA are made in the UK, this could result in the Spanish parent company being UK tax resident under the CMC test, even though it is incorporated in Spain.

This would create dual residence:
- Spain would consider Solaris Future SA resident under Spanish law
- UK would consider it resident under CMC test
- **Dual resident companies are excluded from DTA protection**
- Risk of unrelieved double taxation on worldwide profits

**RECOMMENDATION**: Solaris Future SA should NOT hold board meetings in the UK. All strategic decisions should be made exclusively in Spain to preserve Spanish-only tax residence.

[Annotation: ✓✓ Gold star answer - spotting the risk not explicitly asked about shows deep understanding. Examiners LOVE this. Can earn 3-5 bonus marks for professional skepticism.]

**MARK ALLOCATION** (Estimated based on suggested solutions):

| Element | Marks |
|---------|-------|
| Correct citation of s.14 CTA 2009 | 1-2 |
| Application: UK incorporation = UK residence | 2 |
| CMC test explanation (even if not needed) | 2-3 |
| Application of CMC to facts | 2-3 |
| Tax consequences (CT, filing, TP) | 4-5 |
| Dual residence risk identification (parent) | 3-4 |
| Recommendations | 2 |
| **TOTAL** | **16-21/25** |

**Time Taken**: Approximately 18-22 minutes for this level of answer

### Error Prevention: Top 10 Mistakes

**MISTAKE #1**: "Assuming UK incorporation alone is sufficient - not addressing CMC"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Company is UK incorporated so it's UK resident." [Stop]
- ✅ **Correct**: State s.14 CTA 2009, THEN discuss CMC for completeness
- **Why it matters**: Shows thorough understanding, earns extra marks

**MISTAKE #2**: "Confusing Central Management & Control (CMC) with Place of Effective Management (POEM)"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Using these terms interchangeably  
- ✅ **Correct**: CMC = UK domestic law test; POEM = treaty tie-breaker test
- **Prevention**: Always clarify which test you're applying and why

**MISTAKE #3**: "Ignoring dual residence risk"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Not flagging when company appears resident in 2+ countries
- ✅ **Correct**: Explicitly state "dual residence" and warn of no treaty protection
- **Why critical**: This is a major risk that loses significant marks if missed

**MISTAKE #4**: "Citing wrong legislation"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Under FA 2013..." (that's SRT for individuals!)
- ✅ **Correct**: CTA 2009 s.14-18 for corporate residence
- **Prevention**: Memorize key statutes - write them on scrap paper at start of exam

**MISTAKE #5**: "Failing to apply treaty tie-breaker when both countries claim residence"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Company is resident in both UK and Spain." [Stop]
- ✅ **Correct**: Apply Article 4(3) POEM test to determine single treaty residence
- **Why it matters**: Treaty analysis worth 4-6 marks typically

**MISTAKE #6**: "Describing what should happen, not what the facts show"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Board meetings should be held in Spain..."
- ✅ **Correct**: "The facts state board meetings ARE held in [location]..."
- **Golden Rule**: Answer based on facts AS GIVEN, not as they should be

**MISTAKE #7**: "Knowledge dumping without application"
- ❌ **Wrong**: 3 paragraphs about De Beers case + no mention of actual facts
- ✅ **Correct**: 1 sentence citing De Beers + 2 paragraphs applying to specific facts
- **Ratio**: 20% law / 80% application = optimal mark conversion

**MISTAKE #8**: "Missing the 'substance' red flags"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Ignoring facts like "short-term rental," "no role in negotiating contracts"
- ✅ **Correct**: Flag lack of substance → risk of CMC in another country
- **Examiner loves**: When you spot planning risks not explicitly asked about

**MISTAKE #9**: "Forgetting to distinguish 'formal approval' vs 'actual decision-making'"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Board formally approves in Spain so CMC is Spain"
- ✅ **Correct**: "Real decisions made in UK → CMC in UK (rubber-stamp approval in Spain irrelevant)"
- **Case law basis**: Wood v Holden [2006] - where REAL control exercised

**MISTAKE #10**: "Running out of time - no conclusion"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Detailed analysis + no conclusion at end
- ✅ **Correct**: Even if short of time, write: "Conclusion: [Company] is UK resident because [1-2 reasons]"
- **Why critical**: Conclusions worth 2-3 marks and take 30 seconds to write

### Quick Reference: Key Legislation & Cases

**Statutes** (memorize these):
- **CTA 2009 s.14**: Company incorporated in UK = UK resident
- **CTA 2009 s.15**: Registration in UK (for foreign companies)
- **CTA 2009 s.18**: Double tax agreements override domestic law
- **TIOPA 2010**: Treaty provisions (Article 4 residence)

**Case Law** (know principles):
- **De Beers Consolidated Mines v Howe [1906]**: CMC = where real business carried on
- **Unit Construction v Bullock [1960]**: CMC = where control actually exercised
