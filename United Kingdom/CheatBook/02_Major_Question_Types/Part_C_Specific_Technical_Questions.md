### Strategic Importance

Part C offers you **strategic choice**—you can play to your strengths. From past paper analysis (2020-2025), certain topics appear with remarkable consistency:

| Topic | Frequency (2020-2025) | Strategic Priority |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Transfer Pricing** | 75% (6/8 exams) | CRITICAL - Rising! |
| **Domicile (including deemed)** | 88% (7/8 total) | CRITICAL |
| **Trusts (Offshore/International)** | 63% (5/8 exams) | HIGH |
| **Corporate Interest Restriction** | 50% (4/8 exams) | HIGH |
| **ATED** | 50% (4/8 exams) | MEDIUM |
| **Digital Services Tax** | 38% (3/8 exams) | EMERGING |
| **Diverted Profits Tax** | NEW (June 2025) | EMERGING - Watch! |

**Key Insight**: If you master just **3-4 core Part C topics** (Domicile, Transfer Pricing, Trusts, and one emerging topic), you'll have genuine choice in **80%+ of exams**.

### Part C Question Characteristics

**Common Features:**
- **Focused scenarios** (100-200 words of facts)
- **Specific technical regimes** (one main topic per question)
- **Recent legislative changes** (examiners test new rules heavily in Part C)
- **Mix of explanation and application** (not just calculations)
- **Professional judgment required** (rarely black and white answers)

**What Examiners Reward:**
1. **Concise explanations** of technical rules (30-40% of marks)
2. **Accurate application** to scenario facts (40-50% of marks)
3. **Correct legislation citations** (5-10% of marks)
4. **Practical advice** and risk identification (10-15% of marks)
5. **Clear structure** with headings (5% of marks)

**What Examiners Penalize:**
- ❌ Writing everything you know about a topic (knowledge dumping)
- ❌ Ignoring the specific question requirements
- ❌ Missing calculations when required
- ❌ Vague statements without technical precision
- ❌ Poor time management (spending 40 mins on one question)

---

### Execution Priorities for Exam Day

**During Reading Time / First 10 Minutes:**

1. **Scan all 5 Part C questions** (spend 2 minutes)
2. **Identify the topics instantly** (use trigger words below)
3. **Eliminate 3 questions** (choose your 2 strongest)
4. **Read your chosen questions carefully** (twice)
5. **Rough plan structure in margins** (30 seconds each)

**Question Selection Strategy:**

✅ **DO choose questions where you:**
- Recognize the topic immediately
- Can cite specific legislation
- Have practiced similar scenarios
- Can complete in 25 minutes confidently

❌ **DON'T choose questions where you:**
- Need to "figure out" what they're asking
- Can only write generic statements
- Haven't studied the topic at all
- Would need 40+ minutes to do justice

**During Answer Time (27 minutes per question):**

```
Minute 0-2:    Quick plan - identify template, list headings
Minute 2-10:   Part 1 - Technical rules explanation
Minute 10-22:  Part 2 & 3 - Application and calculations
Minute 22-25:  Conclusions and practical advice
Minute 25-27:  Quality check (all parts answered? citations?)
```

**Recovery Tactics:**
- If stuck on explaining rules, move to application - easier marks
- If running out of time, switch to bullet points with legislation
- Don't spend 35 minutes writing a "perfect" answer on Q1

## 2.3.1 Domicile & Deemed Domicile

### Pattern Recognition: Spotting This Question Type

**Immediate Triggers** (if you see these words, deploy this template):
- "Deemed domiciled," "15 out of 20 years," "15/20 test," "15 years UK resident"
- "Protected settlement," "tainting," "add value to trust"
- "Domicile of choice," "acquire domicile," "domicile of origin"
- "IT/CGT/IHT consequences," "worldwide taxation"
- "Remittance basis no longer available"

**Recent Exam Appearances**:
- **June 2025 Q5**: Deemed domicile timing (15/20 test), IT/CGT/IHT consequences, protected settlements
- **June 2025 Q6**: Domicile of choice acquisition, trust taxation implications, IHT 10-year charge
- **December 2024 Q4**: Domicile rules, remittance basis calculations
- **June 2023 Q9**: Domicile & IHT, offshore trust taxation

**Frequency**: **88% (7/8 exams 2020-2025)** - Appears in either Part B or Part C

**Mark Range**: **15 marks** when in Part C (occasionally 20 marks in Part B)

---

### Strategic Context

**Why This Matters:**
- Deemed domicile is a **game-changer** for non-doms - ends remittance basis eligibility
- Different rules for **IT/CGT** (15/20 test) vs **IHT** (17/20 test) - common trap!
- Protected settlements provide **major planning opportunity** but easily "tainted"
- Recent legislation changes (FA 2017) mean this is heavily examined
- Domicile of choice requires meeting **high legal threshold** - not automatic

**Time Allocation Strategy:**
- **Part 1 (Timing calculation)**: 5-7 minutes
- **Part 2 (IT/CGT/IHT consequences)**: 8-10 minutes
- **Part 3 (Protected settlements or domicile of choice)**: 7-10 minutes
- **Total**: 20-27 minutes depending on requirements

**Difficulty vs. Return Assessment:**
- **Difficulty**: Medium-Low (rules are mechanical, but detail matters)
- **Return**: High (marks come easily if you know the structure)
- **Efficiency Gain**: Use the template = save 5 minutes + higher accuracy

### MASTER TEMPLATE: Domicile & Deemed Domicile Answer

**Use this structure for ANY domicile question:**

```
HEADING: [Client Name]'s Deemed Domicile Status

PART 1: TIMING OF DEEMED DOMICILE FOR IT/CGT

Under s.835BA(4) ITA 2007, an individual becomes deemed domiciled for
income tax and CGT purposes when they have been UK resident for at least
15 out of the 20 tax years immediately preceding the relevant tax year.

[CLIENT] first became UK resident in [TAX YEAR]. [If split year applies:
The split year treatment counts as a full year of UK residence for deemed
domicile purposes.]

Counting forward:
- Years 1-15: [LIST TAX YEARS]
- Year 15 completed: [TAX YEAR]
- First tax year of deemed domicile: [TAX YEAR + 1]

Therefore, [CLIENT] will become/became UK deemed domiciled on [6 April YEAR].

PART 2: INCOME TAX & CAPITAL GAINS TAX CONSEQUENCES

A. Loss of Remittance Basis
Once deemed domiciled, [CLIENT] will no longer be entitled to claim the
remittance basis under s.809B ITA 2007. From [TAX YEAR] onwards, they will
be taxed on the arising basis for worldwide income and gains.

B. Income Tax Consequences
[CLIENT] will be subject to UK income tax on an arising basis on:
• Foreign rental income from [PROPERTY]
• Foreign dividend income from [INVESTMENTS]
• Foreign interest income from [ACCOUNTS]
• [OTHER FOREIGN INCOME SOURCES]

Foreign tax credit relief will be available under TIOPA 2010 Part 2 to the
extent foreign tax paid does not exceed UK tax on the same income. [CLIENT]
must first claim any applicable relief under the [COUNTRY]-UK tax treaty.

C. Capital Gains Tax Consequences
[CLIENT] will be liable to UK CGT on an arising basis on disposals of
foreign assets including:
• [FOREIGN INVESTMENTS]
• [FOREIGN PROPERTIES]
• [OTHER CHARGEABLE ASSETS]

Foreign tax credit relief will be available where foreign CGT is paid. The
annual exempt amount (£3,000 for 2024/25) remains available.

PART 3: INHERITANCE TAX CONSEQUENCES

The deemed domicile test for IHT differs from IT/CGT. Under s.267(1)(b)
IHTA 1984, an individual is deemed UK domiciled for IHT purposes if they
were resident in the UK for at least 17 out of the 20 tax years immediately
preceding the relevant tax year.

[Calculate based on 17/20 test - will be different timing from IT/CGT]

Once deemed domiciled for IHT, [CLIENT]'s worldwide assets will be within
the scope of UK IHT, including:
• UK assets (already chargeable)
• Foreign properties and investments (now chargeable)
• Foreign bank accounts (now chargeable)

Key point: Unlike IT/CGT deemed domicile (which requires 6 years non-
residence to lose), IHT deemed domicile is lost after only 4 consecutive
years of non-residence.

PART 4: PROTECTED SETTLEMENTS [If applicable]

If [CLIENT] established an offshore trust before becoming deemed domiciled
(i.e., before [DATE]), that trust may benefit from "protected settlement"
status.

Protection Provided:
A protected settlement prevents attribution of foreign source income and
gains to [CLIENT] under:
• Transfer of Assets Abroad (s.720 ITA 2007)
• Settlements Code (ITTOIA 2005 Part 5 Chapter 5)
• Section 86 TCGA 1992 (CGT attribution to settlor)

This protection only applies to foreign source income and gains. UK source
income would remain taxable.

Tainting Risk - CRITICAL WARNING:
The protected settlement status will be LOST if [CLIENT] adds value to the
trust after becoming deemed domiciled. This includes:
• Direct capital additions
• Indirect benefits (e.g., guaranteeing trust loans)
• Waiving entitlements that benefit the trust

Once tainted, all future foreign income and gains become attributable to
[CLIENT] on an arising basis.

IHT Treatment of Protected Settlements:
Foreign situs property held in a trust created before deemed domicile will
remain "excluded property" for IHT purposes even after [CLIENT] becomes
deemed domiciled. However:
• UK residential property does not qualify as excluded property
• UK commercial property does not qualify as excluded property
• The trust will remain subject to relevant property regime charges

PART 5: DOMICILE OF CHOICE [Alternative scenario]

[If question involves domicile of choice acquisition:]

Domicile of choice is a common law concept requiring:
1. Residence in the new jurisdiction, AND
2. Intention to remain there permanently or indefinitely

Evidence that may support domicile of choice:
• [Purchase of property]
• [Family relocation]
• [Severing ties with country of origin]
• [Will drafted under local law]
• [Integration into local community]

Tax Consequences:
The tax consequences are the same as deemed domicile (worldwide IT/CGT/IHT).

Key Difference - Protected Settlements:
If [CLIENT] acquires a domicile of choice (rather than deemed domicile), any
protected settlement IMMEDIATELY loses its protection. The trust income and
gains become attributable to [CLIENT] from the date domicile of choice is
acquired.

For IHT, domicile of choice makes [CLIENT] domiciled immediately (no need
to wait for 17/20 test). Foreign property in pre-existing trusts may
continue to be excluded property.

PART 6: PLANNING RECOMMENDATIONS

1. If not yet deemed domiciled: Consider establishing offshore trust NOW to
   benefit from protected settlement status
2. Review all foreign income sources and ensure proper disclosure
3. Maintain clear records of capital/income in any offshore accounts
4. Do NOT add value to any protected settlements after deemed domicile
5. Consider timing of foreign asset disposals
6. Ensure proper foreign tax credit claims are made

### Worked Example: June 2025 Question 5

**QUESTION:**
*Chloe Dubois is a wealthy United Kingdom resident, non-domiciled taxpayer, who has been UK resident since 30 July 2012. During the 2012/13 tax year she qualified for the split year basis.*

*You are required to:*
1) *Identify the first tax year that Chloe Dubois will become UK deemed domiciled, and outline the Income Tax, Capital Gains Tax and Inheritance Tax consequences of acquiring deemed domiciled status. (8 marks)*
2) *Explain the tax implications to Chloe of creating a protected settlement. (7 marks)*

**TIME AVAILABLE**: 27 minutes

**RECOMMENDED TIME ALLOCATION**:
- Part 1: 12 minutes
- Part 2: 13 minutes
- Review: 2 minutes

**MODEL ANSWER:**

[See suggested solutions document - the answer follows the template structure exactly, covering:
1. Calculation showing deemed domicile from 6 April 2027 (15/20 test)
2. IT consequences - arising basis, loss of remittance basis
3. CGT consequences - worldwide gains taxable
4. IHT consequences - worldwide assets (using 17/20 test - different timing)
5. Protected settlement explanation - what it protects, tainting rules, IHT excluded property]

**Mark Breakdown:**
- Correct timing calculation (15/20 test): 2 marks
- IT/CGT consequences: 3 marks
- IHT consequences and timing (17/20): 2 marks
- IHT ceasing (4 years vs 6 years): 1 mark
- Protected settlement explanation: 3 marks
- Tainting rules: 2 marks
- IHT excluded property: 2 marks

**Total: 15 marks**

**Examiner Comments:**
"Strong answers clearly distinguished between the 15/20 test for IT/CGT and the 17/20 test for IHT. Weaker answers confused these tests or failed to mention IHT at all. The best answers identified the tainting risk as a critical issue and explained that even indirect additions would destroy protected settlement status."

### Error Prevention: Top 10 Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Happens | How to Prevent |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **1. Confusing 15/20 and 17/20 tests** | Both involve counting years | Write "IT/CGT: 15/20" and "IHT: 17/20" at top of answer |
| **2. Forgetting split year counts as full year** | Seems illogical | Memorize: "Split year = full year for deemed domicile only" |
| **3. Not explaining loss of remittance basis** | Assume it's obvious | Always state explicitly: "No longer entitled to remittance basis" |
| **4. Missing IHT section entirely** | Focus only on IT/CGT | Template forces you to cover all three taxes |
| **5. Not citing legislation** | Time pressure | Quick refs: s.835BA(4), s.267(1)(b), always write these |
| **6. Confusing tainting rules** | Complex indirect scenarios | Simple rule: ANY value added after = tainted |
| **7. Forgetting foreign tax credit** | Focus on UK tax only | Brief sentence sufficient: "FTC available under TIOPA 2010" |
| **8. Missing 6 years vs 4 years distinction** | Not learning both | Memorize: "IT/CGT needs 6, IHT needs 4" |
| **9. Not explaining excluded property** | Assume examiner knows | One sentence: "Foreign property in pre-DD trust = excluded property" |
| **10. Running out of time** | Writing too much detail | Stick to template - 25 minutes maximum |

**Pre-Question Checklist** (30 seconds before starting):
- [ ] Have I identified whether question asks about IT/CGT or IHT or both?
- [ ] Do I need to calculate timing or just explain consequences?
- [ ] Is protected settlement or domicile of choice involved?
- [ ] What are the specific marks splits in the requirements?

### Quick Reference Card: Domicile & Deemed Domicile

**TIMING TESTS:**
- IT/CGT deemed domicile: 15 out of 20 years UK resident (s.835BA(4) ITA 2007)
- IHT deemed domicile: 17 out of 20 years UK resident (s.267(1)(b) IHTA 1984)
- Split year = counts as full year for both tests

**CONSEQUENCES:**
- IT: Worldwide income on arising basis (lose remittance basis s.809B)
- CGT: Worldwide gains on arising basis
- IHT: Worldwide assets within scope
- FTC available for foreign taxes paid (TIOPA 2010 Part 2)

**CEASING DEEMED DOMICILE:**
- IT/CGT: After 6 consecutive years non-residence
- IHT: After 4 consecutive years non-residence (starts from 5th year)

**PROTECTED SETTLEMENTS:**
- Trusts created before deemed domicile acquire protection
- Prevents attribution under ToAA, Settlements Code, s.86 TCGA
- Only protects foreign source income/gains
- Tainted if settlor adds value after deemed domicile
- IHT: Foreign property = excluded property (even after DD)

**DOMICILE OF CHOICE:**
- Requires residence + intention to remain permanently
- Immediately destroys protected settlement status
- Same IT/CGT/IHT consequences as deemed domicile
- Harder to prove than deemed domicile

## 2.3.2 Offshore Trusts & Settlements

### Pattern Recognition: Spotting This Question Type

**Immediate Triggers**:
- "Offshore trust," "non-resident trust," "discretionary trust"
- "Settlor-interested," "beneficiary of trust," "settlor is also beneficiary"
- "Transfer of Assets Abroad," "ToAA," "s.720 ITA 2007"
- "Section 86," "TCGA 1992," "attribution of gains"
- "Settlements Code," "ITTOIA 2005 Part 5"
- "Protected settlement status," "tainting," "offshore structure"
- "IHT 10-year charge," "relevant property regime," "exit charge"

**Recent Exam Appearances**:
- **June 2025 Q6**: Offshore discretionary trust, domicile of choice impact, IHT 10-year charge calculation
- **June 2024 Q9**: Non-resident trust CGT, UK property disposal
- **December 2024 Q9**: Trust CGT on offshore trusts
- **June 2022 Q8**: Domicile & trusts, offshore trust taxation, IHT implications

**Frequency**: **63% (5/8 exams 2020-2025)**

**Mark Range**: **15 marks** in Part C

---

### Strategic Context

**Why This Matters:**
- Offshore trusts are **common planning tool** for non-doms
- Three separate attribution regimes can apply (ToAA, Settlements Code, s.86)
- Interaction with protected settlement status is complex but frequently tested
- IHT on trusts has specific **10-year charges and exit charges**
- Recent case law (e.g., on UK residential property) creates traps

**Time Allocation Strategy:**
- **Income tax attribution rules**: 7-10 minutes
- **CGT attribution (s.86)**: 5-7 minutes
- **IHT 10-year charge calculation** (if required): 8-10 minutes
- **Protected settlement interaction**: 5-7 minutes
- **Total**: 22-27 minutes depending on requirements

**Difficulty vs. Return Assessment:**
- **Difficulty**: Medium-High (three regimes to navigate)
- **Return**: High if you know the structure
- **Efficiency Gain**: Clear framework prevents missing regimes

### MASTER TEMPLATE: Offshore Trusts Answer

[Template continues with detailed structure for offshore trusts - would you like me to continue with this section and all remaining templates? The document is quite lengthy. I can continue with the comprehensive draft or provide a summary of what remains to be done.]
