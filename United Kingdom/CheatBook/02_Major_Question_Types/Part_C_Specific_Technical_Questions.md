### Strategic Importance

Part C offers you **strategic choice**—you can play to your strengths. From past paper analysis (2020-2025), certain topics appear with remarkable consistency:

| Topic | Frequency (2020-2025) | Strategic Priority |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Transfer Pricing** | 75% (6/8 exams) | CRITICAL - Rising! |
| **Domicile (including deemed)** | 88% (7/8 total) | CRITICAL |
| **Trusts (Offshore/International)** | 63% (5/8 exams) | HIGH |
| **Corporate Interest Restriction** | 50% (4/8 exams) | HIGH |
| **ATED** | 50% (4/8 exams) | MEDIUM |
| **Digital Services Tax** | 38% (3/8 exams) | EMERGING |
| **Diverted Profits Tax** | NEW (June 2025) | EMERGING - Watch! |

**Key Insight**: If you master just **3-4 core Part C topics** (Domicile, Transfer Pricing, Trusts, and one emerging topic), you'll have genuine choice in **80%+ of exams**.

### Part C Question Characteristics

**Common Features:**
- **Focused scenarios** (100-200 words of facts)
- **Specific technical regimes** (one main topic per question)
- **Recent legislative changes** (examiners test new rules heavily in Part C)
- **Mix of explanation and application** (not just calculations)
- **Professional judgment required** (rarely black and white answers)

**What Examiners Reward:**
1. **Concise explanations** of technical rules (30-40% of marks)
2. **Accurate application** to scenario facts (40-50% of marks)
3. **Correct legislation citations** (5-10% of marks)
4. **Practical advice** and risk identification (10-15% of marks)
5. **Clear structure** with headings (5% of marks)

**What Examiners Penalize:**
- ❌ Writing everything you know about a topic (knowledge dumping)
- ❌ Ignoring the specific question requirements
- ❌ Missing calculations when required
- ❌ Vague statements without technical precision
- ❌ Poor time management (spending 40 mins on one question)

---

### Execution Priorities for Exam Day

**During Reading Time / First 10 Minutes:**

1. **Scan all 5 Part C questions** (spend 2 minutes)
2. **Identify the topics instantly** (use trigger words below)
3. **Eliminate 3 questions** (choose your 2 strongest)
4. **Read your chosen questions carefully** (twice)
5. **Rough plan structure in margins** (30 seconds each)

**Question Selection Strategy:**

✅ **DO choose questions where you:**
- Recognize the topic immediately
- Can cite specific legislation
- Have practiced similar scenarios
- Can complete in 25 minutes confidently

❌ **DON'T choose questions where you:**
- Need to "figure out" what they're asking
- Can only write generic statements
- Haven't studied the topic at all
- Would need 40+ minutes to do justice

**During Answer Time (27 minutes per question):**

```
Minute 0-2:    Quick plan - identify template, list headings
Minute 2-10:   Part 1 - Technical rules explanation
Minute 10-22:  Part 2 & 3 - Application and calculations
Minute 22-25:  Conclusions and practical advice
Minute 25-27:  Quality check (all parts answered? citations?)
```

**Recovery Tactics:**
- If stuck on explaining rules, move to application - easier marks
- If running out of time, switch to bullet points with legislation
- Don't spend 35 minutes writing a "perfect" answer on Q1

## 2.3.1 Domicile & Deemed Domicile

### Pattern Recognition: Spotting This Question Type

**Immediate Triggers** (if you see these words, deploy this template):
- "Deemed domiciled," "15 out of 20 years," "15/20 test," "15 years UK resident"
- "Protected settlement," "tainting," "add value to trust"
- "Domicile of choice," "acquire domicile," "domicile of origin"
- "IT/CGT/IHT consequences," "worldwide taxation"
- "Remittance basis no longer available"

**Recent Exam Appearances**:
- **June 2025 Q5**: Deemed domicile timing (15/20 test), IT/CGT/IHT consequences, protected settlements
- **June 2025 Q6**: Domicile of choice acquisition, trust taxation implications, IHT 10-year charge
- **December 2024 Q4**: Domicile rules, remittance basis calculations
- **June 2023 Q9**: Domicile & IHT, offshore trust taxation

**Frequency**: **88% (7/8 exams 2020-2025)** - Appears in either Part B or Part C

**Mark Range**: **15 marks** when in Part C (occasionally 20 marks in Part B)

---

### Strategic Context

**Why This Matters:**
- Deemed domicile is a **game-changer** for non-doms - ends remittance basis eligibility
- Same 15/20 test applies for **IT/CGT** and **IHT** (aligned by FA 2017)
- Protected settlements provide **major planning opportunity** but easily "tainted"
- Recent legislation changes (FA 2017) mean this is heavily examined
- Domicile of choice requires meeting **high legal threshold** - not automatic

**Time Allocation Strategy:**
- **Part 1 (Timing calculation)**: 5-7 minutes
- **Part 2 (IT/CGT/IHT consequences)**: 8-10 minutes
- **Part 3 (Protected settlements or domicile of choice)**: 7-10 minutes
- **Total**: 20-27 minutes depending on requirements

**Difficulty vs. Return Assessment:**
- **Difficulty**: Medium-Low (rules are mechanical, but detail matters)
- **Return**: High (marks come easily if you know the structure)
- **Efficiency Gain**: Use the template = save 5 minutes + higher accuracy

### MASTER TEMPLATE: Domicile & Deemed Domicile Answer

**Use this structure for ANY domicile question:**

```
HEADING: [Client Name]'s Deemed Domicile Status

PART 1: TIMING OF DEEMED DOMICILE FOR IT/CGT

Under s.835BA(4) ITA 2007, an individual becomes deemed domiciled for
income tax and CGT purposes when they have been UK resident for at least
15 out of the 20 tax years immediately preceding the relevant tax year.

[CLIENT] first became UK resident in [TAX YEAR]. [If split year applies:
The split year treatment counts as a full year of UK residence for deemed
domicile purposes.]

Counting forward:
- Years 1-15: [LIST TAX YEARS]
- Year 15 completed: [TAX YEAR]
- First tax year of deemed domicile: [TAX YEAR + 1]

Therefore, [CLIENT] will become/became UK deemed domiciled on [6 April YEAR].

PART 2: INCOME TAX & CAPITAL GAINS TAX CONSEQUENCES

A. Loss of Remittance Basis
Once deemed domiciled, [CLIENT] will no longer be entitled to claim the
remittance basis under s.809B ITA 2007. From [TAX YEAR] onwards, they will
be taxed on the arising basis for worldwide income and gains.

B. Income Tax Consequences
[CLIENT] will be subject to UK income tax on an arising basis on:
• Foreign rental income from [PROPERTY]
• Foreign dividend income from [INVESTMENTS]
• Foreign interest income from [ACCOUNTS]
• [OTHER FOREIGN INCOME SOURCES]

Foreign tax credit relief will be available under TIOPA 2010 Part 2 to the
extent foreign tax paid does not exceed UK tax on the same income. [CLIENT]
must first claim any applicable relief under the [COUNTRY]-UK tax treaty.

C. Capital Gains Tax Consequences
[CLIENT] will be liable to UK CGT on an arising basis on disposals of
foreign assets including:
• [FOREIGN INVESTMENTS]
• [FOREIGN PROPERTIES]
• [OTHER CHARGEABLE ASSETS]

Foreign tax credit relief will be available where foreign CGT is paid. The
annual exempt amount (£3,000 for 2024/25) remains available.

PART 3: INHERITANCE TAX CONSEQUENCES

The deemed domicile test for IHT is now the same as IT/CGT (aligned by FA 2017).
Under s.267(1)(b) IHTA 1984 as amended, an individual is deemed UK domiciled
for IHT purposes if they were resident in the UK for at least 15 out of the
20 tax years immediately preceding the relevant tax year.

[Calculate based on 15/20 test - same timing as IT/CGT since FA 2017]

Once deemed domiciled for IHT, [CLIENT]'s worldwide assets will be within
the scope of UK IHT, including:
• UK assets (already chargeable)
• Foreign properties and investments (now chargeable)
• Foreign bank accounts (now chargeable)

Key point: Unlike IT/CGT deemed domicile (which requires 6 years non-
residence to lose), IHT deemed domicile is lost after only 4 consecutive
years of non-residence.

PART 4: PROTECTED SETTLEMENTS [If applicable]

If [CLIENT] established an offshore trust before becoming deemed domiciled
(i.e., before [DATE]), that trust may benefit from "protected settlement"
status.

Protection Provided:
A protected settlement prevents attribution of foreign source income and
gains to [CLIENT] under:
• Transfer of Assets Abroad (s.720 ITA 2007)
• Settlements Code (ITTOIA 2005 Part 5 Chapter 5)
• Section 86 TCGA 1992 (CGT attribution to settlor)

This protection only applies to foreign source income and gains. UK source
income would remain taxable.

Tainting Risk - CRITICAL WARNING:
The protected settlement status will be LOST if [CLIENT] adds value to the
trust after becoming deemed domiciled. This includes:
• Direct capital additions
• Indirect benefits (e.g., guaranteeing trust loans)
• Waiving entitlements that benefit the trust

Once tainted, all future foreign income and gains become attributable to
[CLIENT] on an arising basis.

IHT Treatment of Protected Settlements:
Foreign situs property held in a trust created before deemed domicile will
remain "excluded property" for IHT purposes even after [CLIENT] becomes
deemed domiciled. However:
• UK residential property does not qualify as excluded property
• UK commercial property does not qualify as excluded property
• The trust will remain subject to relevant property regime charges

PART 5: DOMICILE OF CHOICE [Alternative scenario]

[If question involves domicile of choice acquisition:]

Domicile of choice is a common law concept requiring:
1. Residence in the new jurisdiction, AND
2. Intention to remain there permanently or indefinitely

Evidence that may support domicile of choice:
• [Purchase of property]
• [Family relocation]
• [Severing ties with country of origin]
• [Will drafted under local law]
• [Integration into local community]

Tax Consequences:
The tax consequences are the same as deemed domicile (worldwide IT/CGT/IHT).

Key Difference - Protected Settlements:
If [CLIENT] acquires a domicile of choice (rather than deemed domicile), any
protected settlement IMMEDIATELY loses its protection. The trust income and
gains become attributable to [CLIENT] from the date domicile of choice is
acquired.

For IHT, domicile of choice makes [CLIENT] domiciled immediately (no need
to wait for 15/20 test). Foreign property in pre-existing trusts may
continue to be excluded property.

PART 6: PLANNING RECOMMENDATIONS

1. If not yet deemed domiciled: Consider establishing offshore trust NOW to
   benefit from protected settlement status
2. Review all foreign income sources and ensure proper disclosure
3. Maintain clear records of capital/income in any offshore accounts
4. Do NOT add value to any protected settlements after deemed domicile
5. Consider timing of foreign asset disposals
6. Ensure proper foreign tax credit claims are made

### Worked Example: June 2025 Question 5

**QUESTION:**
*Chloe Dubois is a wealthy United Kingdom resident, non-domiciled taxpayer, who has been UK resident since 30 July 2012. During the 2012/13 tax year she qualified for the split year basis.*

*You are required to:*
1) *Identify the first tax year that Chloe Dubois will become UK deemed domiciled, and outline the Income Tax, Capital Gains Tax and Inheritance Tax consequences of acquiring deemed domiciled status. (8 marks)*
2) *Explain the tax implications to Chloe of creating a protected settlement. (7 marks)*

**TIME AVAILABLE**: 27 minutes

**RECOMMENDED TIME ALLOCATION**:
- Part 1: 12 minutes
- Part 2: 13 minutes
- Review: 2 minutes

**MODEL ANSWER:**

[See suggested solutions document - the answer follows the template structure exactly, covering:
1. Calculation showing deemed domicile from 6 April 2027 (15/20 test)
2. IT consequences - arising basis, loss of remittance basis
3. CGT consequences - worldwide gains taxable
4. IHT consequences - worldwide assets (using 15/20 test - same timing as IT/CGT)
5. Protected settlement explanation - what it protects, tainting rules, IHT excluded property]

**Mark Breakdown:**
- Correct timing calculation (15/20 test): 2 marks
- IT/CGT consequences: 3 marks
- IHT consequences and timing (15/20): 2 marks
- IHT ceasing (4 years vs 6 years): 1 mark
- Protected settlement explanation: 3 marks
- Tainting rules: 2 marks
- IHT excluded property: 2 marks

**Total: 15 marks**

**Examiner Comments:**
"Strong answers correctly applied the 15/20 test for both IT/CGT and IHT (aligned since FA 2017). Weaker answers used outdated 17/20 rule for IHT or failed to mention IHT at all. The best answers identified the tainting risk as a critical issue and explained that even indirect additions would destroy protected settlement status."

### Error Prevention: Top 10 Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Happens | How to Prevent |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **1. Using outdated 17/20 test for IHT** | Old rule pre-FA 2017 | Remember: FA 2017 aligned both to 15/20 for IT/CGT AND IHT |
| **2. Forgetting split year counts as full year** | Seems illogical | Memorize: "Split year = full year for deemed domicile only" |
| **3. Not explaining loss of remittance basis** | Assume it's obvious | Always state explicitly: "No longer entitled to remittance basis" |
| **4. Missing IHT section entirely** | Focus only on IT/CGT | Template forces you to cover all three taxes |
| **5. Not citing legislation** | Time pressure | Quick refs: s.835BA(4), s.267(1)(b), always write these |
| **6. Confusing tainting rules** | Complex indirect scenarios | Simple rule: ANY value added after = tainted |
| **7. Forgetting foreign tax credit** | Focus on UK tax only | Brief sentence sufficient: "FTC available under TIOPA 2010" |
| **8. Missing 6 years vs 4 years distinction** | Not learning both | Memorize: "IT/CGT needs 6, IHT needs 4" |
| **9. Not explaining excluded property** | Assume examiner knows | One sentence: "Foreign property in pre-DD trust = excluded property" |
| **10. Running out of time** | Writing too much detail | Stick to template - 25 minutes maximum |

**Pre-Question Checklist** (30 seconds before starting):
- [ ] Have I identified whether question asks about IT/CGT or IHT or both?
- [ ] Do I need to calculate timing or just explain consequences?
- [ ] Is protected settlement or domicile of choice involved?
- [ ] What are the specific marks splits in the requirements?

### Quick Reference Card: Domicile & Deemed Domicile

**TIMING TESTS:**
- IT/CGT deemed domicile: 15 out of 20 years UK resident (s.835BA(4) ITA 2007)
- IHT deemed domicile: 15 out of 20 years UK resident (s.267(1)(b) IHTA 1984 as amended by FA 2017)
- Split year = counts as full year for both tests

**CONSEQUENCES:**
- IT: Worldwide income on arising basis (lose remittance basis s.809B)
- CGT: Worldwide gains on arising basis
- IHT: Worldwide assets within scope
- FTC available for foreign taxes paid (TIOPA 2010 Part 2)

**CEASING DEEMED DOMICILE:**
- IT/CGT: After 6 consecutive years non-residence
- IHT: After 4 consecutive years non-residence (starts from 5th year)

**PROTECTED SETTLEMENTS:**
- Trusts created before deemed domicile acquire protection
- Prevents attribution under ToAA, Settlements Code, s.86 TCGA
- Only protects foreign source income/gains
- Tainted if settlor adds value after deemed domicile
- IHT: Foreign property = excluded property (even after DD)

**DOMICILE OF CHOICE:**
- Requires residence + intention to remain permanently
- Immediately destroys protected settlement status
- Same IT/CGT/IHT consequences as deemed domicile
- Harder to prove than deemed domicile

## 2.3.2 Offshore Trusts & Settlements

### Pattern Recognition: Spotting This Question Type

**Immediate Triggers**:
- "Offshore trust," "non-resident trust," "discretionary trust"
- "Settlor-interested," "beneficiary of trust," "settlor is also beneficiary"
- "Transfer of Assets Abroad," "ToAA," "s.720 ITA 2007"
- "Section 86," "TCGA 1992," "attribution of gains"
- "Settlements Code," "ITTOIA 2005 Part 5"
- "Protected settlement status," "tainting," "offshore structure"
- "IHT 10-year charge," "relevant property regime," "exit charge"

**Recent Exam Appearances**:
- **June 2025 Q6**: Offshore discretionary trust, domicile of choice impact, IHT 10-year charge calculation
- **June 2024 Q9**: Non-resident trust CGT, UK property disposal
- **December 2024 Q9**: Trust CGT on offshore trusts
- **June 2022 Q8**: Domicile & trusts, offshore trust taxation, IHT implications

**Frequency**: **63% (5/8 exams 2020-2025)**

**Mark Range**: **15 marks** in Part C

---

### Strategic Context

**Why This Matters:**
- Offshore trusts are **common planning tool** for non-doms
- Three separate attribution regimes can apply (ToAA, Settlements Code, s.86)
- Interaction with protected settlement status is complex but frequently tested
- IHT on trusts has specific **10-year charges and exit charges**
- Recent case law (e.g., on UK residential property) creates traps

**Time Allocation Strategy:**
- **Income tax attribution rules**: 7-10 minutes
- **CGT attribution (s.86)**: 5-7 minutes
- **IHT 10-year charge calculation** (if required): 8-10 minutes
- **Protected settlement interaction**: 5-7 minutes
- **Total**: 22-27 minutes depending on requirements

**Difficulty vs. Return Assessment:**
- **Difficulty**: Medium-High (three regimes to navigate)
- **Return**: High if you know the structure
- **Efficiency Gain**: Clear framework prevents missing regimes

## 2.3.3 Transfer Pricing

### Pattern Recognition: Spotting This Question Type

**Immediate Triggers**:
- "Transfer pricing," "arm's length," "related party transaction"
- "OECD Guidelines," "comparability analysis"
- "Intra-group services," "management fees," "royalties," "IP"
- "TIOPA 2010 Part 4," "s.147"
- "Master file," "local file," "Country-by-Country Reporting"
- "Advance Pricing Agreement (APA)"

**Recent Exam Appearances**:
- **June 2025 Part C Q7**: Transfer Pricing methodologies and documentation (15 marks)
- **June 2024 Part C Q5**: TP adjustments and penalties (15 marks)
- **June 2023 Part C Q6**: TP compliance and APAs (15 marks)
- **December 2022 Part C Q5**: Arm's length principle application (15 marks)
- **June 2022 Part C Q6**: TP documentation requirements (15 marks)
- **December 2021 Part C Q7**: TP methods (CUP, TNMM) (15 marks)

**Frequency**: **75% (6/8 exams) - CRITICAL TOPIC**

---

### Strategic Context

**Transfer Pricing** ensures that transactions between related parties are priced as if they were between independent parties (the "arm's length principle"). This prevents profit shifting to low-tax jurisdictions.

**UK Legislative Framework**:
- **TIOPA 2010 Part 4** (ss.147-230): Primary UK TP legislation
- **OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines**: Interpretive guidance (UK follows closely)
- **Finance Act 2024**: Enhanced documentation requirements

**Why This Topic Appears Frequently**:
- 15% syllabus weighting (Section I.D)
- Tests both technical rules AND practical application
- Increasing HMRC focus on TP compliance
- OECD/BEPS developments continue to evolve

### MASTER TEMPLATE: Transfer Pricing Answer

```
TRANSFER PRICING ANALYSIS: [Transaction Description]

Legislative Framework: TIOPA 2010 Part 4 (ss.147-230)
Guidance: OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines

1. TRANSACTION IDENTIFICATION

   Parties:
   • [UK Company] - UK tax resident
   • [Related Party] - Resident in [Country]

   Relationship:
   • [Parent/subsidiary/common control]
   • [X]% ownership by [entity]
   • Connected persons under s.148 TIOPA 2010: [YES/NO]

   Transaction:
   • Nature: [Goods / Services / IP / Finance]
   • Description: [Detailed description]
   • Value: £[amount] per annum
   • Terms: [Payment terms, duration, etc.]

2. SME EXEMPTION (s.166 TIOPA 2010)

   [UK Company] SME status:
   • Employees: [number] [<250 / ≥250]
   • Turnover: €[amount] [≤€50m / >€50m]
   • Balance sheet: €[amount] [≤€43m / >€43m]

   SME Exemption: [APPLIES / DOES NOT APPLY]

   [If applies]: TP rules do not apply to this transaction
   (unless counterparty in non-qualifying territory).

   [If does not apply]: Full TP analysis required below.

3. ARM'S LENGTH ANALYSIS

   Would independent parties transact on these terms?

   COMPARABILITY FACTORS:

   ① Characteristics of property/services:
      [Describe - quality, availability, volume, etc.]

   ② Functions performed:
      [UK Company]: [Functions, risks, assets employed]
      [Related Party]: [Functions, risks, assets employed]

   ③ Contractual terms:
      [Payment terms, warranties, delivery, etc.]

   ④ Economic circumstances:
      [Market conditions, geographic location, competition]

   ⑤ Business strategies:
      [Market penetration, new product launch, etc.]

4. TRANSFER PRICING METHOD SELECTION

   Most Appropriate Method: [CUP / RPM / CPM / TNMM / PSM]

   Justification:
   [Explain why this method is most appropriate given:
    - Availability of comparables
    - Reliability of data
    - Nature of transaction
    - Functions/risks of parties]

   [METHOD APPLICATION - Choose relevant method]:

   [If CUP]:
   Comparable transactions identified:
   • [Comparable 1]: Price £[X] per unit
   • [Comparable 2]: Price £[Y] per unit
   Arm's length range: £[X] to £[Y]
   Actual price: £[Z]
   Within range? [YES/NO]

   [If TNMM]:
   Tested party: [UK Company / Related Party]
   Profit Level Indicator (PLI): [Operating margin / Berry ratio / ROA]

   Comparable companies:
   | Company | PLI |
   |---------|-----|
   | Comp 1  | X%  |
   | Comp 2  | Y%  |
   | Comp 3  | Z%  |

   Interquartile range: [X]% to [Y]%
   Median: [Z]%

   [UK Company] actual PLI: [A]%
   Within arm's length range? [YES/NO]

   [If NO - Calculate adjustment]:
   Adjustment to reach median:
   Revenue × (Median PLI - Actual PLI) = £[adjustment]

5. TRANSFER PRICING ADJUSTMENT (if required)

   Arm's length price/profit: £[X]
   Actual price/profit: £[Y]

   TP Adjustment required: £[X - Y]

   Tax effect:
   Adjustment × Corporation Tax rate = £[adjustment] × [rate]%
   Additional UK tax: £[amount]

6. DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

   [UK Company] documentation obligations:

   ✓ Master File: [Required / Not required]
     Reason: [Group revenue >€750m / <€750m]

   ✓ Local File: [Required for this transaction]
     Contents: Functional analysis, comparability study,
     method selection, financial data
     Deadline: [Filing date for CT return]

   ✓ CbCR: [Required / Not required]
     Reason: [Ultimate parent revenue >€750m / <€750m]

7. RECOMMENDATIONS

   [Provide practical advice]:

   • [If adjustment required]: Review pricing policy, consider
     APA for future certainty

   • [If compliant]: Maintain contemporaneous documentation,
     update benchmarking study periodically (every 3 years)

   • [Risk mitigation]: Consider bilateral APA if transactions
     material and risk of double taxation exists

   • [Penalties]: Ensure documentation prepared before filing
     to avoid penalties of up to 100% of understated tax

CONCLUSION

[Transaction] [is / is not] at arm's length.

[If adjustment required]: A transfer pricing adjustment of
£[amount] is required, increasing UK taxable profits.

[If compliant]: No adjustment required, but [UK Company]
should maintain documentation to support arm's length position.

### Error Prevention: Top 5 Transfer Pricing Mistakes

| # | Mistake | How to Avoid | Impact |
|---|---------|--------------|--------|
| **1** | **Not checking SME exemption first** | Always verify SME status - can save significant analysis time | -2 marks |
| **2** | **Choosing wrong TP method** | Match method to transaction type and available comparables | -3 to -4 marks |
| **3** | **Ignoring documentation requirements** | State Master/Local/CbCR obligations explicitly | -2 marks |
| **4** | **Not performing comparability analysis** | OECD requires 5-factor comparability analysis | -3 marks |
| **5** | **Forgetting APA as planning option** | Always mention APA for significant/recurring transactions | -1 to -2 marks |

## 2.3.4 Corporate Interest Restriction (CIR)

### Pattern Recognition: Spotting This Question Type

**Immediate Triggers**:
- "Corporate Interest Restriction," "CIR," "interest limitation"
- "Fixed ratio rule," "30% EBITDA," "group ratio"
- "Tax-interest," "interest allowance," "disallowed amounts"
- "£2 million de minimis," "interest reactivation"
- "TIOPA 2010 Part 10"
- "Public infrastructure exemption"

**Recent Exam Appearances**:
- **June 2025 Part A Q2**: CIR with unallowable purpose (within 25-mark question)
- **December 2023 Part C Q6**: CIR fixed ratio calculation (15 marks)
- **June 2023 Part C Q7**: CIR group ratio election (15 marks)
- **December 2022 Part C Q6**: CIR interaction with thin cap (15 marks)

**Frequency**: **50% (4/8 exams) - HIGH PRIORITY**

---

### Strategic Context

The **Corporate Interest Restriction (CIR)** limits the amount of interest that UK companies can deduct against their UK profits. It implements OECD BEPS Action 4 recommendations to prevent base erosion through excessive interest deductions.

**UK Legislative Framework**:
- **TIOPA 2010 Part 10** (ss.372-498): CIR rules
- Effective from 1 April 2017

**Key Principle**: A group's UK tax-interest deductions are limited to 30% of UK tax-EBITDA (or the group ratio if higher).

### MASTER TEMPLATE: CIR Answer

```
CORPORATE INTEREST RESTRICTION ANALYSIS

Legislative Framework: TIOPA 2010 Part 10

1. SCOPE AND DE MINIMIS TEST

   UK group companies: [List companies]

   Net UK tax-interest expense:

   | Company | Interest Expense | Interest Income | Net |
   |---------|-----------------|-----------------|-----|
   | Co A    | £[_______]      | £[_______]      | £[__] |
   | Co B    | £[_______]      | £[_______]      | £[__] |
   | Total   | £[_______]      | £[_______]      | £[__] |

   Total net UK interest: £[________]
   De minimis threshold: £2,000,000

   [If ≤ £2m]: CIR does NOT restrict deductions. No further
   analysis required.

   [If > £2m]: CIR applies. Continue analysis.

2. TAX-EBITDA CALCULATION

   | Company | Taxable Profit | + Net Interest | + Cap Allow | = Tax-EBITDA |
   |---------|---------------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
   | Co A    | £[_______]    | £[_______]     | £[_______]  | £[_______]   |
   | Co B    | £[_______]    | £[_______]     | £[_______]  | £[_______]   |
   | Total   |               |                |             | £[_______]   |

   Aggregate UK Tax-EBITDA: £[________]

3. FIXED RATIO CALCULATION (30%)

   Aggregate UK tax-EBITDA                £[________]
   × Fixed ratio                          × 30%
   = Fixed ratio debt cap                 £[________]

   Add: Aggregate interest income         £[________]
   = Interest allowance (fixed ratio)     £[________]

4. GROUP RATIO ELECTION (if applicable)

   [Only calculate if group ratio potentially higher than 30%]

   Worldwide group figures (from consolidated accounts):

   Qualifying net group-interest expense   £[________]
   Group EBITDA                            £[________]

   Group ratio = [Interest] / [EBITDA] =   [___]%

   [If group ratio > 30%]:
   UK tax-EBITDA × Group ratio =           £[________]

   Higher allowance: [Fixed ratio / Group ratio]

   [Election required for group ratio - joint election by
   all UK group companies]

5. RESTRICTION CALCULATION

   Net UK tax-interest expense             £[________]
   Less: Interest allowance                (£[________])
   = Disallowed amount                     £[________]

   [If positive]: Interest of £[amount] is disallowed.
   [If negative/zero]: No restriction applies.

6. ALLOCATION OF DISALLOWANCE

   Disallowed amount allocated pro rata:

   | Company | Interest Expense | % of Total | Disallowance |
   |---------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
   | Co A    | £[_______]      | [__]%      | £[_______]   |
   | Co B    | £[_______]      | [__]%      | £[_______]   |
   | Total   | £[_______]      | 100%       | £[_______]   |

   Each company adds back its disallowed amount to taxable profits.

7. TAX IMPACT

   Additional corporation tax:

   | Company | Disallowance | × CT Rate | Additional Tax |
   |---------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
   | Co A    | £[_______]   | × [__]%   | £[_______]     |
   | Co B    | £[_______]   | × [__]%   | £[_______]     |
   | Total   |              |           | £[_______]     |

8. CARRY FORWARD POSITION

   Disallowed amounts create IADA for each company:
   • Can be reactivated in future periods
   • When interest allowance exceeds actual interest expense
   • Carried forward indefinitely

   [Any unused interest allowance]:
   • Carried forward up to 5 years
   • Can shelter future excess interest

9. RECOMMENDATIONS

   • [If restricted]: Consider group ratio election if
     worldwide leverage exceeds 30%

   • [Planning]: Review debt structure - consider:
     - External vs intra-group debt mix
     - Timing of interest payments
     - Location of debt within group

   • [Compliance]: Prepare interest restriction return
     within 12 months of period end

CONCLUSION

The group's UK interest deduction is [restricted / not restricted]
under CIR.

[If restricted]: £[amount] of interest is disallowed, resulting
in additional corporation tax of approximately £[amount].

Disallowed amounts can be reactivated in future periods if
interest allowance exceeds actual interest expense.

### Error Prevention: Top 5 CIR Mistakes

| # | Mistake | How to Avoid | Impact |
|---|---------|--------------|--------|
| **1** | **Forgetting £2m de minimis** | Always check de minimis first - many groups fall below | -2 marks |
| **2** | **Using accounting EBITDA not tax-EBITDA** | Tax-EBITDA starts from taxable profits, not accounting | -3 marks |
| **3** | **Not considering group ratio election** | If worldwide leverage >30%, group ratio may be beneficial | -2 marks |
| **4** | **Missing carry forward rules** | Explain IADA and interest allowance carry forward | -1 to -2 marks |
| **5** | **Confusing CIR with thin cap** | CIR = overall interest cap; Thin cap = arm's length debt | -2 marks |

## 2.3.5 ATED (Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings)

### Pattern Recognition: Spotting This Question Type

**Immediate Triggers**:
- "Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings," "ATED"
- "Non-natural person," "company-owned residential property"
- "Enveloped dwelling," "UK residential property"
- "£500,000 threshold," "annual charge"
- "Property rental business relief," "property developer relief"
- "FA 2013 Schedule 33"

**Recent Exam Appearances**:
- **December 2024 Part C Q6**: ATED charge and reliefs (15 marks)
- **June 2023 Part C Q5**: ATED calculation with reliefs (15 marks)
- **December 2022 Part C Q8**: ATED and ATED-related CGT (15 marks)
- **June 2021 Part C Q5**: ATED compliance (15 marks)

**Frequency**: **50% (4/8 exams) - HIGH PRIORITY**

---

### Strategic Context

**ATED** is an annual tax charge on UK residential properties valued over £500,000 when held by "non-natural persons" (companies, partnerships with corporate members, collective investment schemes).

**Purpose**: Discourage "enveloping" (holding property through companies) to avoid stamp duty and IHT.

**UK Legislative Framework**:
- **FA 2013 Schedule 33-35**: ATED provisions
- **FA 2013 s.100-174**: ATED-related CGT

**Why This Topic Appears Frequently**:
- Straightforward calculation (good for Part C)
- Tests knowledge of reliefs (practical application)
- Links to broader property tax themes

   Less: Relief claimed                 (£[________])
   Net ATED payable                     £[________]

5. COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

   Chargeable period: 1 April [year] to 31 March [year+1]

   ATED return due: 30 April [year]

   [If relief claimed]:
   Relief return still required by 30 April [year]

   [If new acquisition]:
   Return due within 30 days of acquisition: [date]
   Payment due: Same date

6. ATED-RELATED CGT (if disposal)

   [If property being sold]:

   ATED period: [Start date] to [End date]
   Total ownership: [X] days
   ATED period: [Y] days

   [If no ATED relief claimed during ownership]:
   ATED-related gain = £[gain] × [Y]/[X] = £[________]
   ATED-related CGT @ 28% = £[________]

   [If ATED relief claimed]:
   Period covered by relief not subject to ATED-related CGT
   Normal CGT rules apply to that period

7. RECOMMENDATIONS

   • [If ATED applies with no relief]: Consider restructuring
     (e.g., transfer to individuals, partnership)

   • [If relief applicable]: Ensure conditions maintained
     throughout period; document compliance

   • [Compliance]: File return by 30 April even if relief
     claimed; maintain valuation evidence for revaluation dates

   • [Planning]: Review before 1 April 2027 revaluation
     - properties may move bands

CONCLUSION

[Property] [is / is not] subject to ATED.

[If subject]: The annual ATED charge is £[amount].
[Relief] relief [applies / does not apply], resulting in
net ATED payable of £[amount].

Return and payment due by [date].

### Error Prevention: Top 5 ATED Mistakes

| # | Mistake | How to Avoid | Impact |
|---|---------|--------------|--------|
| **1** | **Forgetting relief return still required** | Even with 100% relief, ATED return must be filed | -2 marks |
| **2** | **Using wrong valuation date** | Use 1 April 2022 (or acquisition if later) not current value | -2 marks |
| **3** | **Missing pro-rata for part-year** | If acquired/disposed mid-year, pro-rate the charge | -2 marks |
| **4** | **Not checking all relief conditions** | Rental relief requires ALL conditions (commercial, arm's length, etc.) | -2 to -3 marks |
| **5** | **Forgetting ATED-related CGT on disposal** | If ATED applied, disposal triggers ATED-related CGT at 28% | -2 marks |

## 2.3.6 Additional Part C Topics (Brief Coverage)

The following topics appear less frequently in Part C but candidates should have basic familiarity:

### Withholding Taxes (Cross-Border Payments)

**Key Points**:
- **Dividends**: Generally no UK withholding tax on dividends paid by UK companies
- **Interest**: 20% withholding on "yearly interest" unless:
  - Paid to UK resident
  - Treaty relief applies (most treaties reduce to 0%)
  - Quoted Eurobond exemption
  - Short interest (loan ≤1 year)
- **Royalties**: 20% withholding unless treaty relief (most treaties reduce to 0%)
- **Legislation**: ITA 2007 Part 15, CTA 2010 Part 21

**Exam Tip**: Focus on when withholding APPLIES and treaty relief procedures.

---

### Exit Charges & Corporate Migration

**Key Points**:
- **Corporate exit charge** (s.185 TCGA 1992): Deemed disposal at market value when company ceases UK residence
- **Postponement**: May postpone charge if migrating to EEA state (pay in instalments)
- **Treaty override**: If treaty makes company non-UK resident, exit charge still applies
- **Individual emigration**: Temporary non-residence rules (TNR) claw back gains if return within 5 years
- **Legislation**: TCGA 1992 s.185, TIOPA 2010 s.25

**Exam Tip**: Usually combined with corporate residence questions in Part A.

---

### Inheritance Tax (International Aspects)

**Key Points**:
- **Scope**: UK domiciled = worldwide assets; Non-UK domiciled = UK situs assets only
- **Deemed domicile**: 15 of 20 years UK resident = deemed UK domiciled for IHT
- **Excluded property**: Non-UK assets of non-UK domiciled individual
- **Double tax relief**: Limited treaty network (only ~10 IHT treaties)
- **Legislation**: IHTA 1984 ss.6, 48, 267

**Exam Tip**: Often tested with domicile questions - know the interaction.

---

### Stamp Taxes, NICs & VAT (Brief)

**Stamp Taxes**:
- SDLT: UK land transactions (rates vary by property type/value)
- Stamp duty: UK shares (0.5%)
- Cross-border: No SDLT on non-UK property; no stamp duty on non-UK shares

**NICs (International)**:
- UK NICs apply if working in UK
- Social security agreements may allocate liability elsewhere
- A1 certificate confirms social security status

**VAT (Cross-Border)**:
- Place of supply rules determine which country taxes
- B2B services: Customer location
- B2C services: Varies by service type
- Post-Brexit: UK now "third country" for EU VAT purposes

**Exam Tip**: These topics rarely appear as standalone Part C questions. More likely as components of Part A/B questions.
