## Answer Structure Template

### STAGE 1: Introduction and Framework (2-3 marks, 3-4 minutes)

**What to Write:**

```
Domicile is a common law concept that determines an individual's permanent home
for UK tax purposes. Unlike residence (which can change frequently) and nationality
(which is a legal status), domicile reflects where a person considers their permanent
home to be.

Domicile is relevant for:
• UK Inheritance Tax scope (worldwide estate vs. UK assets only)
• Income Tax and CGT (eligibility for remittance basis)
• Trust taxation (settlor-interested rules, offshore trusts)

There are three types of domicile under common law:
1. Domicile of Origin - acquired at birth from parent
2. Domicile of Dependency - for children under 16
3. Domicile of Choice - acquired by residence + intention to remain permanently

In addition, statutory "deemed domicile" rules may apply, which override
common law domicile for certain tax purposes.

The key issue is to determine [Name]'s domicile status for [tax year/purpose].
```

**Marking Notes:**
- Definition of domicile: 0.5 marks
- Relevance to UK tax: 0.5 marks
- Three types identified: 1 mark
- Deemed domicile mentioned: 0.5 marks
- Issue identification: 0.5 marks

**Common Errors:**
- ❌ Confusing domicile with residence or nationality
- ❌ Forgetting deemed domicile rules exist
- ❌ Not stating which type of domicile is in question

### STAGE 2: Domicile of Origin Analysis (2-3 marks, 3-4 minutes)

**Template:**

```
DOMICILE OF ORIGIN

[Name] was born on [date] in [country] to parents who were [married/unmarried].

At the time of [Name]'s birth:
• Father's domicile: [country]
• Mother's domicile: [country]
• Parents' marital status: [married/unmarried]

RULE: A legitimate child (born to married parents) takes their father's domicile
of origin. An illegitimate child (or if father deceased) takes their mother's
domicile of origin.

Legislation: Common law rule (no statute)
Key case: Udny v Udny (1869) - domicile of origin established at birth

APPLICATION: Since [Name]'s parents were [married/unmarried], [Name] acquired
domicile of origin from [father/mother] at birth.

CONCLUSION: [Name]'s domicile of origin is [Country].

IMPORTANT: Domicile of origin can be displaced by acquiring a domicile of choice,
but it NEVER dies. If a domicile of choice is later abandoned without acquiring
a new domicile of choice, the domicile of origin automatically revives.

Key case: IRC v Bullock [1976] - domicile of origin "clings tenaciously"
```

**Marking Breakdown:**
- Birth circumstances stated: 0.5 marks
- Correct rule identified (married/unmarried): 1 mark
- Case law cited: 0.5 marks
- Domicile of origin correctly determined: 0.5 marks
- "Never dies" principle mentioned: 0.5 marks

**Key Legislation:**
- Common law (no statute)
- Udny v Udny (1869)
- IRC v Bullock [1976]

### STAGE 3: Domicile of Choice Analysis (6-8 marks, 8-10 minutes)

**This is the highest-scoring section - allocate most time here**

**Template:**

```
DOMICILE OF CHOICE ANALYSIS

To acquire a domicile of choice, [Name] must satisfy TWO essential requirements:

1. RESIDENCE in the new country (objective test)
2. INTENTION to remain permanently or indefinitely (subjective test)

Both requirements must be satisfied simultaneously. The standard of proof is
very high - the burden is on the person claiming a change of domicile to prove
both elements.

Key case: Ramsey v IRC [1999] - "clear and unequivocal" evidence required

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

REQUIREMENT 1: RESIDENCE

Facts:
• [Name] arrived in [Country] on [date]
• Period of residence: [X] years ([date] to [present/date])
• Nature of residence: [continuous/intermittent, lawful/unlawful]
• Visa/immigration status: [permanent residence/work permit/other]

Analysis:
Physical presence in [Country] is clearly established. [Name] has resided
in [Country] for [X] years, which is [sufficient/insufficient] to demonstrate
residence for domicile purposes.

[If relevant: Note any absences, temporary departures, or residence elsewhere]

There is no minimum time period required for residence, but longer residence
provides stronger evidence of both elements.

Key case: Qazi v HMRC [2016] - 7 years' residence not sufficient on its own

Conclusion on Residence: The residence requirement [is/is not] satisfied.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

REQUIREMENT 2: INTENTION TO REMAIN PERMANENTLY

This is the more difficult requirement. The test examines whether [Name]
intends to make [Country] their permanent home for the rest of their life,
or at least for an indefinite period.

The intention must be:
• To remain PERMANENTLY or INDEFINITELY (not just long-term)
• Present at the time (not a future intention)
• Genuine and fixed (not conditional or uncertain)

"Permanently" does NOT mean forever - it means without any present intention
to leave. An individual can acquire domicile of choice while retaining the
possibility of future return to another country, provided there is no definite
intention to do so.

Key case: Re Fuld (No. 3) [1968] - "he intends to make his home in that
other country until the end of his days, unless and until something happens
to make him change his mind"

EVIDENCE OF INTENTION:

The court examines objective evidence of intention. Mere statements of intention
carry little weight - actions speak louder than words.

Key case: Henkes v Netherlands [2011] ECJ - objective factors paramount

Evidence SUPPORTING intention to remain permanently in [Country]:

1. Property Ownership:
   [✓/✗] Purchased property in [Country]: [details]
   [✓/✗] Sold/retained property in [origin country]: [details]

   [✓/✗] Children in school in [Country]
   [✓/✗] Family members remain in [origin country]: [who?]

4. Social and Cultural Integration:

   [✓/✗] Active in local community
   [✓/✗] Friendships established in [Country]

5. Financial Connections:

   [✓/✗] Expressed burial wishes in [Country]
   [✓/✗] Obtained citizenship/permanent residence permit

7. Immigration Status:
   [✓/✗] Applied for permanent residence/citizenship
   [✓/✗] Type of visa: [indefinite/temporary]

8. Statements of Intention:
   [✓/✗] Written/verbal statements about permanent move
   [✓/✗] Told friends/family of permanent intentions

Evidence AGAINST intention to remain permanently in [Country]:

1. Ties Retained in [Origin Country]:
   [✓/✗] Property retained in [origin country]
   [✓/✗] Business interests maintained
   [✓/✗] Bank accounts retained
   [✓/✗] Frequent visits to [origin country]

2. Temporary Immigration Status:
   [✓/✗] Work permit only (not permanent residence)
   [✓/✗] Visa with time limit
   [✓/✗] Did not apply for citizenship/permanent residence

3. Statements Indicating Temporary Stay:
   [✓/✗] Expressed intention to return to [origin country]
   [✓/✗] Plans to retire in [origin country]
   [✓/✗] Referenced move as "temporary" or "for now"

4. Family Not Established in [Country]:
   [✓/✗] Spouse/children remained in [origin country]
   [✓/✗] Children sent to school in [origin country]

5. Career/Business Plans:
   [✓/✗] Employment contract for fixed term only
   [✓/✗] Business ties suggesting future return

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

WEIGHING THE EVIDENCE:

[This is the most important part - analyze and weigh competing factors]

Strong factors supporting domicile of choice in [Country]:
• [List the 2-3 strongest factors from above]
• [Explain WHY each is significant]

Strong factors against domicile of choice in [Country]:
• [List the 2-3 strongest factors from above]
• [Explain WHY each is significant]

Balance of Evidence:
[Provide reasoned analysis of which factors outweigh the others]

Case Law Comparison:
Compare facts to leading cases:

• IRC v Bullock [1976]: Canadian-born barrister lived in UK for 40 years,
  but retained ties to Canada. Held: NOT domiciled in UK - domicile of origin
  "clings tenaciously."

• Ramsey v IRC [1999]: Belgian living in UK for many years but always intended
  to return to Belgium. Held: NOT UK domiciled - clear evidence of intention
  to return.

• Qazi v HMRC [2016]: Pakistani national living in UK for 7 years, but case
  centered on residence, not domicile. Illustrates that length of residence
  alone is insufficient.

• Henkes v Netherlands [2011]: Emphasized objective factors over stated intentions.

[Compare [Name]'s situation to these precedents]

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CONCLUSION ON DOMICILE OF CHOICE:

On the balance of probabilities, [Name] [HAS/HAS NOT] acquired a domicile of
choice in [Country] because:

[Provide clear reasoning - 2-3 sentences]

Key factors:
1. [Most important factor]
2. [Second most important factor]

Therefore, [Name]'s domicile under common law is [Country].

[If domicile of choice NOT acquired: [Name] retains domicile of origin in
[Original Country]]

### STAGE 4: Deemed Domicile Rules (3-5 marks, 6-8 minutes)

**Template:**

```
DEEMED DOMICILE - STATUTORY RULES

Even if [Name] is NOT domiciled in the UK under common law principles, they
may be treated as UK domiciled for certain tax purposes under statutory
"deemed domicile" rules.

IMPORTANT: There are DIFFERENT deemed domicile rules for different taxes:

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

OPTION A: DEEMED DOMICILE FOR INHERITANCE TAX

Legislation: IHTA 1984, s. 267

An individual is deemed UK domiciled for IHT purposes if EITHER:

1. They were UK resident in at least 15 of the 20 tax years immediately
   before the relevant time, OR

2. They were domiciled in the UK under common law at any time within the
   3 years immediately before the relevant time

Analysis for [Name]:

Test 1: 15 of 20 Years Test

UK Residence History (last 20 years):
[List each tax year and residence status]

Tax Year | UK Resident?
---------|-------------
[Year 1] | [Yes/No]
[Year 2] | [Yes/No]
...      | ...
[Year 20]| [Yes/No]

Count: [Name] was UK resident in [X] of the last 20 tax years.

Result: [X is/is not] at least 15.
Therefore, [Name] [IS/IS NOT] deemed UK domiciled under the 15 of 20 years test.

Test 2: 3-Year Tail

Was [Name] UK domiciled under common law at any time in the last 3 years?
[Yes/No - if yes, specify when]

Result: [Name] [IS/IS NOT] deemed UK domiciled under the 3-year tail rule.

CONCLUSION: [Name] [IS/IS NOT] deemed UK domiciled for IHT purposes.

IHT Consequences:
• If deemed UK domiciled: Worldwide estate subject to UK IHT (including
  non-UK assets). No "excluded property" relief for foreign assets.

• If NOT deemed UK domiciled: Only UK-situs assets subject to IHT. Non-UK
  assets are "excluded property" (IHTA 1984, s. 6).

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

OPTION B: DEEMED DOMICILE FOR INCOME TAX AND CGT

Legislation: FA 2017, Schedule 8 (inserted ITA 2007, s. 835BA)
(Effective from 6 April 2017)

An individual is deemed UK domiciled for income tax and CGT purposes if BOTH:

1. They are UK resident in the current tax year, AND

2. They have been UK resident in at least 15 of the previous 20 tax years

Note: This is STRICTER than the IHT test - they must be CURRENTLY resident.

Analysis for [Name]:

Test 1: Currently UK Resident?
Is [Name] UK resident in [current tax year]?
[Yes/No - if needed, apply SRT briefly]

Result: [Yes/No]

Test 2: 15 of Previous 20 Years
As calculated above, [Name] was UK resident in [X] of the last 20 years.

Result: [X is/is not] at least 15.

CONCLUSION: [Name] [IS/IS NOT] deemed UK domiciled for income tax and CGT
purposes for [tax year].

Income Tax and CGT Consequences:

• If deemed UK domiciled:
  - CANNOT claim remittance basis (even if non-UK domiciled under common law)
  - Taxed on worldwide income and gains on the arising basis
  - Affected years: All years in which they are UK resident after becoming
    deemed domiciled
  - Offshore trust rules: Settlements made while deemed domiciled are subject
    to settlor-interested trust rules

• If NOT deemed UK domiciled:
  - MAY claim remittance basis (if meet other conditions - see ITA 2007, s. 809B)
  - Can keep foreign income/gains offshore without UK tax (if not remitted)
  - Remittance basis charge may apply (£30,000 or £60,000)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN IHT AND INCOME TAX/CGT DEEMED DOMICILE:

| Feature | IHT (IHTA 1984, s. 267) | Income Tax/CGT (ITA 2007, s. 835BA) |
|---------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 15 of 20 test | ✓ Applies | ✓ Applies |
| Must be currently UK resident | ✗ Not required | ✓ Required |
| 3-year tail | ✓ Applies | ✗ Does not apply |
| When introduced | Pre-2017 | From 6 April 2017 |

IMPORTANT: An individual can be deemed domiciled for one tax but not another.
```

**Marking Breakdown:**
- Two different deemed domicile regimes identified: 1 mark
- IHT deemed domicile rules correctly stated: 1 mark
- Income Tax/CGT deemed domicile rules correctly stated: 1 mark
- Correct application to facts (counting years): 1.5 marks
- Tax consequences explained: 1 mark

### STAGE 5: Tax Consequences and Conclusion (2-3 marks, 3-4 minutes)

**Template:**

```
TAX CONSEQUENCES

Based on the analysis above, [Name]'s domicile status is:

• Common law domicile: [Country]
• Deemed domiciled for IHT: [Yes/No]
• Deemed domiciled for Income Tax/CGT: [Yes/No]

SPECIFIC TAX IMPLICATIONS:

1. Inheritance Tax:
   [If UK domiciled or deemed domiciled for IHT]:
   • Worldwide estate subject to UK IHT on death
   • Lifetime transfers of worldwide assets potentially subject to IHT
   • No excluded property relief for non-UK assets
   • [If relevant: spouse exemption implications if spouse different domicile]

   [If NOT UK domiciled for IHT]:
   • Only UK-situs assets subject to IHT (IHTA 1984, s. 6(1))
   • Non-UK assets are "excluded property" - no UK IHT
   • IHT spouse exemption limited to £325,000 if spouse is UK domiciled
     (unless non-dom spouse elects to be treated as UK domiciled)

2. Income Tax and Capital Gains Tax:
   [If UK domiciled or deemed domiciled]:
   • Taxed on worldwide income and gains (arising basis)
   • Cannot claim remittance basis
   • UK resident and deemed domiciled = full UK tax liability

   [If NOT UK domiciled AND not deemed domiciled]:
   • May claim remittance basis (if meet conditions in ITA 2007, s. 809B):
     - UK resident
     - Non-UK domiciled
     - Have unremitted foreign income/gains
   • If claiming remittance basis:
     - Only taxed on UK income/gains + remitted foreign income/gains
     - Lose UK personal allowance and CGT annual exemption
     - Pay remittance basis charge: £30,000 (17 of 20 years UK resident)
       or £60,000 (20 of 20 years)
   • Alternatively, can elect arising basis (no charge, keep allowances)

3. Trust Taxation:
   [If UK domiciled or deemed domiciled]:
   • Offshore trusts: settlor-interested trust rules apply in full
   • Income/gains of trust taxed on settlor if retain benefit

   [If NOT UK domiciled]:
   • More favorable offshore trust treatment
   • Trust income/gains may not be attributed to settlor
   • But: protected trust rules if non-dom becomes deemed domiciled later

PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS:

[Include if relevant to facts]:
• Exit planning opportunities (leave UK before becoming deemed domiciled)
• Trust planning (establish trusts before deemed domicile)
• Remittance planning (if can claim remittance basis)
• "Cleansing" of mixed funds
• [Any specific opportunities from the scenario]

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, [Name] is:
• [UK/non-UK] domiciled under common law
• [Deemed/not deemed] UK domiciled for IHT purposes
• [Deemed/not deemed] UK domiciled for income tax and CGT purposes

The key determining factors were:
1. [Primary factor - e.g., insufficient evidence of intention to remain permanently]
2. [Secondary factor - e.g., but 15 of 20 years UK residence triggers deemed domicile]

This means [Name] will be subject to UK tax as follows:
• [Summarize main consequences in 1-2 sentences]

## Common Variations and Adaptations

### Variation 1: Domicile of Dependent Child

**Scenario:** Question involves child under 16

**Key Rules:**
- Child under 16 has domicile of dependency
- Automatically follows father's domicile (if parents married)
- Automatically follows mother's domicile (if parents unmarried)
- Changes automatically if parent's domicile changes
- Ends at age 16 (or earlier if marriage)

**Template Adaptation:**
```
[Name] is [age] years old (born [date]).

As [Name] is under 16, they have a domicile of dependency under common law.

Rule: A dependent child's domicile follows:
• Father's domicile (if parents are married)
• Mother's domicile (if parents are unmarried)

[Name]'s parents are [married/unmarried].
Father's current domicile: [Country]
Mother's current domicile: [Country]

Therefore, [Name]'s domicile of dependency is [Country].

This domicile will automatically change if [father/mother]'s domicile changes.
At age 16, [Name] will retain this domicile but it will become a domicile of
choice (if remained resident with requisite intention) or revert to domicile
of origin.
```

### Variation 2: Abandonment of Domicile of Choice

**Scenario:** Individual had acquired domicile of choice but then left that country

**Key Rule:** If domicile of choice abandoned without acquiring new domicile of choice,
domicile of origin automatically revives

**Template Addition:**
```
ABANDONMENT OF DOMICILE OF CHOICE

[Name] previously acquired domicile of choice in [Country A] in [year].

However, [Name] left [Country A] in [year] and moved to [Country B].

The question is whether [Name] has:
a) Abandoned domicile of choice in [Country A], and
b) Acquired new domicile of choice in [Country B]

Abandonment Test:
To abandon a domicile of choice, [Name] must have:
• Ceased to reside in [Country A], AND
• Ceased to intend to return permanently

Evidence of abandonment:
[Analyze - did they intend to leave permanently?]

If domicile of choice in [Country A] was abandoned:
• [Name]'s domicile of origin in [Country C] revives automatically
• This happens immediately upon abandonment
• The revival continues unless/until [Name] acquires new domicile of choice

New Domicile of Choice in [Country B]?
[Apply standard domicile of choice test to Country B]

Conclusion:
[Name]'s domicile is [Country].
```

### Variation 3: Multiple Changes of Domicile

**Scenario:** Individual has lived in several countries

**Template Approach:**
- Trace domicile chronologically
- At each point, determine if domicile of choice acquired
- If abandoned, note revival of domicile of origin
- Be clear about timeline

```
DOMICILE HISTORY

1. [Year of birth]: Domicile of origin - [Country A]
2. [Year]: Moved to [Country B]
   Analysis: [Did they acquire domicile of choice? Yes/No - reasoning]
   Domicile: [Country]
3. [Year]: Moved to [Country C]
   Analysis: [Did they acquire domicile of choice? Yes/No - reasoning]
   Domicile: [Country]
4. [Present]: Living in [Country D]
   Analysis: [Apply full test]

Current Domicile: [Country]
```

2. **❌ Forgetting that domicile of origin never dies**
   - ✓ Always mention that domicile of origin can be displaced but revives if
     domicile of choice abandoned
   - ✓ Cite IRC v Bullock - "clings tenaciously"

3. **❌ Insufficient analysis of intention evidence**
   - ✓ Don't just list factors - analyze and weigh them
   - ✓ Explain WHY each factor is significant

5. **❌ Mis-counting the 15 of 20 years**
   - ✓ Count carefully - list out the years if necessary
   - ✓ Remember it's TAX YEARS not calendar years
   - ✓ Check whether it's "last 20 years" (IHT) or "previous 20 years" (IT/CGT)

6. **❌ Not distinguishing between IHT and Income Tax deemed domicile**
   - ✓ Explain both regimes separately

## Quick Reference: Key Rules

### Domicile of Origin
- Acquired at birth from father (if legitimate) or mother (if illegitimate)
- Can be displaced by domicile of choice BUT never extinguished
- Revives automatically if domicile of choice abandoned

### Domicile of Choice
- Requires: (1) Residence + (2) Intention to remain permanently
- Very high burden of proof - "clear and unequivocal evidence"
- Objective evidence of intention (actions > words)
- No minimum time period but longer = better evidence

### Domicile of Dependency
- Children under 16 follow parent's domicile automatically
- Father if parents married; mother if unmarried
- Ends at age 16 or marriage (if earlier)

### Deemed Domicile (IHT)
- UK resident in 15 of last 20 tax years, OR
- UK domiciled under common law within last 3 years
- Legislation: IHTA 1984, s. 267

### Deemed Domicile (Income Tax/CGT)
- UK resident in current year, AND
- UK resident in 15 of previous 20 tax years
- Legislation: ITA 2007, s. 835BA (from 6 April 2017)

## Answer Structure Template

### STAGE 1: Introduction and Framework (2 marks, 2-3 minutes)

**What to Write:**

```
Trusts are widely used in international tax planning, particularly by non-UK
domiciled individuals. The UK has complex rules to prevent avoidance of UK tax
through the use of offshore trusts.

The key UK tax provisions relevant to trusts are:

1. Trust Residence Rules (TCGA 1992, s. 69)
   - Determines whether trust is UK resident or non-resident
   - Critical for determining tax treatment

2. Settlor-Interested Trust Provisions (ITA 2007, ss. 624-628; TCGA 1992, ss. 86-87)
   - Income/gains of certain trusts attributed to UK resident settlor
   - Prevents avoidance through offshore trusts

3. Beneficiary Taxation (TCGA 1992, s. 87)
   - Capital gains matched to capital payments from offshore trusts
   - Attributed to beneficiaries receiving distributions

4. Transfer of Assets Abroad (ITA 2007, Part 13, Chapter 2)
   - Anti-avoidance provisions for income
   - Wider scope than settlor-interested rules

The key issues are:
• Is the trust UK resident or non-resident?
• Are settlor-interested provisions engaged?
• What are the UK tax consequences for [settlor/beneficiary]?

### STAGE 2: Trust Residence (2-3 marks, 4-5 minutes)

**Template:**

```
TRUST RESIDENCE

Trust residence determines the tax treatment of the trust's income and gains.

LEGISLATION: TCGA 1992, s. 69 (for CGT); ITA 2007, s. 475 (for income tax)

RULE: A trust is UK resident for tax purposes if:
• ALL the trustees are UK resident, OR
• At least ONE trustee is UK resident AND the settlor was UK resident or
  ordinarily resident (under pre-2013 rules) when the trust was created,
  OR
• At least ONE trustee is UK resident AND the settlor was domiciled in the UK
  when the trust was created

Note: For trusts created before 6 April 2013, the "ordinarily resident" test applies.
For trusts created after this date, only residence and domicile matter.

ADDITIONAL RULE: Even if one or more trustees are UK resident, the trust may still
be treated as non-UK resident if the trust is administered outside the UK and the
general administration is ordinarily carried on outside the UK (TCGA 1992, s. 69(2)).

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

ANALYSIS FOR [TRUST NAME]

Trust Details:
• Date trust created: [date]
• Settlor: [Name]
• Settlor's residence when trust created: [UK/non-UK]
• Settlor's domicile when trust created: [UK/non-UK]
• Number of trustees: [X]
• Trustees' residence:
  - [Trustee 1]: [UK/non-UK resident]
  - [Trustee 2]: [UK/non-UK resident]
  - [Trustee 3]: [UK/non-UK resident]
• Location of trust administration: [Country]
• Where general administration carried on: [Country]

APPLICATION OF RULES:

Test 1: Are ALL trustees UK resident?
[Yes/No - list trustees and residence]
Result: [Pass/Fail]

Test 2: Is at least ONE trustee UK resident AND was settlor UK resident/ordinarily
resident when trust created?
[Analysis]
Result: [Pass/Fail]

Test 3: Is at least ONE trustee UK resident AND was settlor UK domiciled when
trust created?
[Analysis]
Result: [Pass/Fail]

If any test passed: Consider whether general administration exception applies:
• Is trust administered outside UK? [Yes/No]
• Is general administration ordinarily carried on outside UK? [Yes/No]

Key case: Smallwood v HMRC [2010] - trustees' decision-making location key

CONCLUSION ON TRUST RESIDENCE:

The trust [IS/IS NOT] UK resident for UK tax purposes because [reasoning].

TAX CONSEQUENCES OF RESIDENCE STATUS:

If UK resident trust:
• Income: Taxed at trust rates (45% dividend income; 45% other income above
  £1,000; basic rate band £1,000)
• CGT: Gains taxed at 20% (basic rate band £1,000) or 28% (residential property)
• Annual exemption: £3,000 (or £1,500 if multiple trusts from same settlor)

If non-UK resident trust:
• Income: UK source income may be subject to UK tax (depending on income type)
• CGT: Not subject to UK CGT on disposal of most assets (exception: UK land)
• Settlor-interested provisions may still apply to attribute income/gains to
  UK resident settlor
```

### STAGE 3: Settlor-Interested Provisions (5-7 marks, 8-12 minutes)

**This is typically the highest-scoring section**

**Template:**

```
SETTLOR-INTERESTED TRUST PROVISIONS

Even if a trust is non-UK resident, UK tax may still apply to the settlor if the
trust is "settlor-interested."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

A. INCOME TAX - SETTLEMENTS LEGISLATION

LEGISLATION: ITA 2007, ss. 624-628

CONDITIONS FOR ATTRIBUTION:

The income of a trust is attributed to the settlor if ALL of the following apply:
1. The settlor is UK resident in the tax year
2. The settlor has an "interest" in the settlement (defined below)
3. The trust generates income (UK or foreign source)

DEFINITION OF "INTEREST" (ITA 2007, s. 625):

A settlor has an "interest" in a settlement if:
• The settlor, OR
• The settlor's spouse or civil partner (unless separated), OR
• The settlor's minor children (under 18 and unmarried)

...can benefit from the settlement in any circumstances whatsoever.

This is a very wide definition. Even a remote possibility of benefit is sufficient.

Key case: IRC v Botnar [1999] - very wide interpretation

EXCLUSIONS (ITA 2007, s. 625):
The settlor does NOT have an interest if:
• Benefits are available only on death of a person with a prior interest, AND
• The settlor has not retained an interest during that person's life

APPLICATION TO [SETTLOR/TRUST]:

1. Is [Settlor] UK resident in [tax year]?
   [Yes/No - if needed, brief SRT analysis]
   Result: [Yes/No]

2. Does [Settlor] have an "interest" in the settlement?

   Trust beneficiaries:
   • [List all beneficiaries and their relationship to settlor]

   Can the following benefit?
   • Settlor personally: [Yes/No - how?]
   • Settlor's spouse/civil partner: [Yes/No - who?]
   • Settlor's minor children: [Yes/No - who?]

   Analysis:
   [Even if settlor is not named beneficiary, check if could benefit in any
   circumstances - discretionary powers? Default provisions?]

   Conclusion: [Settlor] [DOES/DOES NOT] have an interest in the settlement
   because [reasoning].

3. Does the trust generate income?
   [Yes/No - what type of income?]

CONCLUSION ON INCOME TAX ATTRIBUTION:

[If all three conditions met]:
The income of the trust is attributed to [Settlor] under ITA 2007, ss. 624-628.

Tax Consequences:
• ALL trust income (UK and foreign) treated as income of [Settlor]
• [Settlor] taxed at their personal income tax rates
• Any tax paid by the trust can be credited against [Settlor]'s liability
• Income treated as highest part of [Settlor]'s income (top-slicing)

Calculation:
Trust income: £[X]
Attributed to [Settlor]: £[X]
Tax on [Settlor] at [rate]%: £[Y]
Less: Tax credit for tax paid by trust: £[Z]
Net tax payable by [Settlor]: £[Y-Z]

[If conditions NOT met]:
The settlor-interested income tax provisions do NOT apply because [reason].
Therefore, trust income is [taxed on trust / not subject to UK tax depending
on trust residence].

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

B. CAPITAL GAINS TAX - SECTION 86 AND SECTION 87

LEGISLATION: TCGA 1992, s. 86 and s. 87

There are TWO separate CGT provisions for trusts:

1. Section 86: Attribution of gains to SETTLOR
2. Section 87: Attribution of gains to BENEFICIARIES (on capital payments)

SECTION 86: ATTRIBUTION TO SETTLOR

CONDITIONS FOR ATTRIBUTION:

Gains of a non-UK resident trust are attributed to the settlor if ALL apply:
1. Trust is NON-UK resident
2. Trust would be settlor-interested if it were UK resident (same test as above)
3. Settlor is UK resident OR UK ordinarily resident (for pre-2013 rules) OR
   UK domiciled
4. Trust disposes of assets generating capital gains

Note: Section 86 does NOT apply if trust is UK resident (trust taxed directly).

IMPORTANT: From 6 April 2017, additional protection for non-domiciled settlors:
If the settlor was non-UK domiciled (and not deemed domiciled) when the trust was
created, section 86 only applies to gains on UK residential property.

This is the "protected trust" rule (TCGA 1992, s. 86A).

APPLICATION TO [SETTLOR/TRUST]:

1. Is trust non-UK resident?
   As determined above: [Yes/No]

2. Would trust be settlor-interested if UK resident?
   As analyzed above: [Yes/No]

3. Is [Settlor] UK resident/domiciled in [tax year]?
   [Yes/No - state status]

4. Protected trust rules:
   Was [Settlor] non-UK domiciled when trust created on [date]?
   [Yes/No - check domicile at creation]

   If YES: Protected trust rules apply
   • Section 86 applies ONLY to gains on UK residential property
   • Gains on other assets NOT attributed to settlor
   • Settlor remains protected even if becomes deemed domiciled later

   If NO: Full attribution of all gains

5. Has trust disposed of assets generating gains in [tax year]?
   [Yes/No - list disposals]

   Gains realized:
   • [Asset 1]: Gain of £[X] [UK residential property: Yes/No]
   • [Asset 2]: Gain of £[Y] [UK residential property: Yes/No]

CONCLUSION ON SECTION 86 ATTRIBUTION:

[If all conditions met and no protection]:
ALL gains of the trust are attributed to [Settlor] under TCGA 1992, s. 86.

[If protected trust]:
Only gains on UK residential property are attributed to [Settlor].
Gains on [other assets] are NOT attributed due to protected trust rules.

[If conditions not met]:
Section 86 does NOT apply because [reason].

Tax Consequences (if section 86 applies):
• Gains attributed to [Settlor]: £[X]
• [Settlor] taxed at their CGT rates (10%/20% or 18%/28% for residential property)
• [Settlor] can use their annual CGT exemption (£3,000 for 2024/25)
• Any tax paid by trust can be credited

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECTION 87: ATTRIBUTION TO BENEFICIARIES

LEGISLATION: TCGA 1992, s. 87 and Sch. 4C

Section 87 applies SEPARATELY from section 86. It attributes gains to beneficiaries
who receive capital payments from non-UK resident trusts.

CONDITIONS FOR ATTRIBUTION:

1. Trust is NON-UK resident
2. Trust has realized capital gains ("section 2(2) amount")
3. Capital payment made to beneficiary who is UK resident (or was UK resident
   in that tax year or any of the previous 4 tax years)
4. Gains have not already been attributed to settlor under section 86

MATCHING MECHANISM:

Section 87 uses a matching system:
• Track cumulative gains realized by trust from 6 April 1991 onwards
• Track cumulative capital payments to each beneficiary
• Match gains to payments on a FIFO basis (first gains match to first payments)

CALCULATION:

Step 1: Calculate "section 2(2) amount" (cumulative unmatched gains)
Step 2: Identify capital payments to beneficiary in tax year
Step 3: Match gains to payments (limited to available section 2(2) amount)
Step 4: Apply supplementary charge (10% for each complete year gain held by trust
        before payment, maximum 60%)

APPLICATION TO [BENEFICIARY/TRUST]:

[Only complete if beneficiary receives capital payment]

1. Is trust non-UK resident?
   [Yes/No]

2. Section 2(2) amount (cumulative unmatched gains):
   Opening balance: £[X]
   Gains realized in [tax year]: £[Y]
   Less: Gains previously matched: £[Z]
   Available section 2(2) amount: £[X+Y-Z]

3. Capital payments to [Beneficiary] in [tax year]:
   [List payments and amounts]
   Total capital payments: £[P]

4. Is [Beneficiary] UK resident in [tax year]?
   [Yes/No]

5. Matching calculation:
   Lower of:
   • Available section 2(2) amount: £[X+Y-Z]
   • Capital payment: £[P]
   = Gain attributed to [Beneficiary]: £[G]

6. Supplementary charge:
   [Calculate if gains held for multiple years before payment]
   Gain arose in: [year]
   Payment made in: [year]
   Complete years held: [N]
   Supplementary charge: [N × 10%, max 60%]

CONCLUSION ON SECTION 87:

[Beneficiary] is attributed capital gains of £[G] under TCGA 1992, s. 87.

Tax Consequences:
• Gain taxed on [Beneficiary] at their CGT rates
• [Beneficiary] can use their annual exemption
• Supplementary charge: £[G] × [N × 10%] = £[S]
• Total tax liability: [calculation]

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PROTECTED SETTLEMENTS (NON-DOMS)

IMPORTANT: For non-UK domiciled settlors, the "protected settlement" rules provide
significant relief (TCGA 1992, s. 86A).

RULE: If trust was created when settlor was non-UK domiciled (and not deemed
domiciled for income tax/CGT), the trust remains "protected" for CGT purposes EVEN IF
the settlor later becomes deemed domiciled.

Protection means:
• Section 86 applies only to gains on UK residential property
• Gains on other assets not attributed to settlor
• Section 87 still applies to beneficiaries

This protection is PERMANENT (survives deemed domicile status).

Legislation: Inserted by FA 2017 to protect pre-existing trust planning.

### STAGE 4: Alternative Anti-Avoidance: Transfer of Assets Abroad (2-3 marks, 4-5 minutes)

**Include if scenario involves income (not just gains)**

**Template:**

```
TRANSFER OF ASSETS ABROAD PROVISIONS

LEGISLATION: ITA 2007, Part 13, Chapter 2 (ss. 714-751)

These are alternative anti-avoidance provisions that may apply INSTEAD OF OR IN
ADDITION TO the settlor-interested provisions.

CONDITIONS FOR APPLICATION:

1. There is a "transfer of assets" (broadly defined - includes creating a trust)
2. Income becomes payable to a non-UK resident person (e.g., the trust)
3. Individual has "power to enjoy" the income
4. Individual is UK resident

WHEN TO CONSIDER:

Transfer of assets abroad provisions should be considered if:
• Settlor-interested provisions do NOT apply (e.g., settlor not beneficiary)
• BUT settlor retains some control or benefit
• Wider scope than settlor-interested provisions

"POWER TO ENJOY" (ITA 2007, s. 721):

Very broad definition - includes:
• Income paid to individual
• Income applied for individual's benefit
• Individual has power to obtain income (even if not exercised)
• Individual can control application of income

TAX TREATMENT:

If provisions apply:
• Income attributed to UK resident individual
• Taxed as income of that individual
• Motive defense available: No tax avoidance purpose (s. 736)

APPLICATION TO [INDIVIDUAL]:

[Brief analysis if relevant - usually not main focus in exam]

1. Has there been a transfer of assets?
   [Yes/No - creation of trust?]

2. Does [Individual] have "power to enjoy" income?
   [Analyze control/benefit]

3. Motive defense available?
   [Was there a genuine non-tax reason for structure?]

CONCLUSION:

The transfer of assets abroad provisions [DO/DO NOT] apply because [reasoning].

[Usually conclude that settlor-interested provisions apply instead, or in addition]

### STAGE 5: Tax Consequences and Conclusion (1-2 marks, 2-3 minutes)

**Template:**

```
TAX CONSEQUENCES AND CONCLUSION

Summary of Trust Tax Treatment:

1. Trust Residence: [UK/non-UK] resident

2. Income Taxation:
   [If settlor-interested provisions apply]:
   • Trust income attributed to [Settlor] under ITA 2007, ss. 624-628
   • [Settlor] taxed on income of £[X] at their personal rates
   • Estimated tax liability: £[Y]

   [If provisions do not apply]:
   • Trust income taxed at trust rates (if UK resident)
   • No UK tax on foreign income (if non-UK resident trust and foreign income)

3. Capital Gains Tax:
   [If section 86 applies]:
   • Trust gains attributed to [Settlor] under TCGA 1992, s. 86
   • [If protected trust: Only UK residential property gains attributed]
   • Gains attributed: £[X]
   • Estimated CGT: £[Y]

   [If section 87 applies]:
   • Gains matched to capital payments to [Beneficiary]
   • Gain attributed: £[X]
   • Supplementary charge: £[Y]
   • Total tax on [Beneficiary]: £[Z]

4. Planning Implications:
   [If relevant - brief points]:
   • [e.g., Settlor should consider excluding self and spouse as beneficiaries]
   • [e.g., Protected trust status valuable - avoid actions that forfeit protection]
   • [e.g., Time capital payments to UK non-resident years if possible]

CONCLUSION:

The UK tax treatment of [Trust] is determined by [key factor - e.g., trust residence
and settlor-interested status].

[Settlor/Beneficiary] will be subject to UK tax on [income/gains/both] because
[key reason].

The total estimated UK tax liability for [tax year] is £[X].

## Common Variations and Adaptations

### Variation 1: Bare Trust vs. Discretionary Trust

**Bare Trust:**
- Beneficiary has absolute entitlement
- Treated as transparent for tax purposes
- Assets/income treated as beneficiary's directly
- No settlor-interested provisions apply (even if settlor created)

**Discretionary Trust:**
- Trustees have discretion over distributions
- Trust taxed separately
- Settlor-interested provisions may apply
- Higher tax rates (45% income tax; 20%/28% CGT)

### Variation 2: Will Trust

**If trust created by will (not lifetime settlement):**
- Settlor = deceased person
- Settlor-interested provisions generally do NOT apply (settlor deceased)
- But special rules for trusts created by will where deceased's spouse is beneficiary
  (ITA 2007, s. 629)
- Focus on beneficiary taxation instead

### Variation 3: Loan Trust vs. Discounted Gift Trust

**These are specific trust planning structures:**

**Loan Trust:**
- Settlor lends money to trust (not gift)
- Loan repayments not distributions (no section 87 charge)
- But interest on loan may be income

**Discounted Gift Trust:**
- Settlor retains right to fixed regular payments
- Settlor-interested for purposes of retained rights
- But future growth not attributed

[Brief recognition if appears in question - not deep analysis unless specifically asked]

## Error Prevention Checklist

### Top 10 Mistakes in Trust Questions

1. **❌ Confusing trust residence with settlor residence**
   - ✓ Analyze trust residence separately using s. 69 test
   - ✓ Trust residence depends on trustees, not just settlor

2. **❌ Forgetting to check settlor-interested status for BOTH income and gains**
   - ✓ Apply BOTH ITA 2007, ss. 624-628 (income) AND TCGA 1992, s. 86 (gains)
   - ✓ These are separate provisions with different consequences

3. **❌ Not recognizing "interest" in settlement is very broad**
   - ✓ Even remote possibility of benefit = interest
   - ✓ Spouse and minor children count as settlor having interest

4. **❌ Missing the protected trust rules for non-doms**
   - ✓ Check if settlor was non-dom when trust created
   - ✓ If yes, only UK residential property gains attributed (major benefit)

5. **❌ Confusing section 86 (settlor) with section 87 (beneficiary)**
   - ✓ Section 86 = gains attributed to settlor (if settlor-interested)
   - ✓ Section 87 = gains matched to beneficiary capital payments
   - ✓ These can apply to SAME trust for different people

6. **❌ Forgetting supplementary charge for section 87**
   - ✓ Add 10% for each complete year gain held by trust before payment
   - ✓ Maximum 60% supplementary charge

7. **❌ Not considering transfer of assets abroad as alternative**
   - ✓ Mention even if ultimately conclude settlor-interested provisions apply
   - ✓ Shows comprehensive understanding

8. **❌ Incomplete trust residence analysis**
   - ✓ Check all THREE tests in s. 69
   - ✓ Consider general administration exception

9. **❌ Missing the interaction with deemed domicile**
   - ✓ Deemed domiciled settlors cannot avoid attribution
   - ✓ But protected trust rules may still help

10. **❌ Not explaining tax consequences clearly**
    - ✓ State WHO is taxed, on WHAT amount, at WHAT rate
    - ✓ Don't just state provisions apply - explain the result

## Answer Structure Template

### STAGE 1: Introduction and Framework (1-2 marks, 2-3 minutes)

**What to Write:**

```
UK withholding tax obligations apply to certain types of payments made by UK payers
to non-UK residents. The main payment types subject to UK withholding tax are:

1. Interest payments (ITA 2007, Part 15)
2. Royalty payments (ITA 2007, Part 15)
3. Some intellectual property payments
4. UK REIT distributions (in certain circumstances)

Note: Dividends paid by UK companies are generally NOT subject to UK withholding
tax (abolished from 1 April 2016 for most dividends).

KEY APPROACH:

Step 1: Identify UK domestic withholding obligation and rate
Step 2: Check if Double Tax Treaty reduces or eliminates withholding
Step 3: Calculate withholding tax liability
Step 4: Identify procedural requirements for treaty relief

The key issue is determining the withholding tax obligation on [payment type]
from [UK payer] to [non-UK recipient] in [country].

```
UK DOMESTIC WITHHOLDING TAX ON INTEREST

LEGISLATION: ITA 2007, ss. 874-876 (duty to deduct)

GENERAL RULE:

A UK company or UK resident making annual interest payments to a non-UK resident

   - Issued by a company
   - Carries right to interest
   - Most common exemption

2. BANK-TO-BANK EXEMPTION (ITA 2007, s. 879)
   - Interest paid by UK bank in ordinary course of banking business
   - To non-UK bank acting in ordinary course of banking business
   - Payment made outside UK

[Yes/No - analyze]

UK Withholding Obligation (before exemptions):
Under ITA 2007, s. 874, [Payer] must withhold income tax at 20% unless an
exemption applies.

Prima facie withholding: £[X] × 20% = £[Y]

CHECK EXEMPTIONS:

Quoted Eurobond Exemption (s. 882)?
• Is the debt a security? [Yes/No]

[Check other exemptions similarly if relevant]

CONCLUSION ON UK DOMESTIC WITHHOLDING:

[If exemption applies]:
No UK withholding tax is required under domestic law because [exemption] applies.
Interest can be paid gross (without deduction).

[If no exemption]:
UK withholding tax of 20% applies under domestic law.

### STAGE 3: Double Tax Treaty Analysis (5-7 marks, 8-12 minutes)

**This is typically the highest-scoring section**

**Template:**

```
DOUBLE TAX TREATY RELIEF

If UK domestic law requires withholding, a Double Tax Treaty (DTT) may reduce
or eliminate the withholding tax rate.

LEGISLATION: TIOPA 2010, s. 2 (treaties have effect under UK law)

OECD MODEL TREATY - STANDARD PROVISIONS:

Article 10 - Dividends: Maximum 5% (substantial shareholding) or 15%
Article 11 - Interest: Maximum 10% (or 0% in many treaties)
Article 12 - Royalties: Maximum 5-10% (or 0% in some treaties)

Note: Actual treaty rates vary by treaty. Always check specific UK-[Country] DTT.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TREATY BETWEEN UK AND [COUNTRY]

Treaty: UK-[Country] Double Tax Treaty [year]

RELEVANT ARTICLE: [Article 11 for interest / Article 12 for royalties]

Full text of relevant article:
[Quote or summarize key provisions of the treaty article]

KEY PROVISIONS:

1. Scope: Does the payment fall within the treaty definition?
   [Analyze whether payment type is covered]

2. Residence: Is recipient resident in [Country] for treaty purposes?
   [Check residence requirement]

3. Beneficial Ownership: Is recipient the beneficial owner?
   [Check beneficial ownership requirement]

4. Rate: What is the maximum withholding rate under the treaty?
   [State treaty rate]

5. Conditions: Are there any special conditions?
   [Any exemptions, limitations, or requirements?]

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

APPLICATION TO [PAYMENT]:

1. SCOPE - Does payment fall within treaty definition?

[For Interest - Article 11]:
Treaty definition of "interest" typically includes:
"Income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage,
and whether or not carrying a right to participate in profits"

Analysis:
The payment of £[X] for [describe payment] [DOES/DOES NOT] fall within the
treaty definition of interest because [reasoning].

[For Royalty - Article 12]:
Treaty definition of "royalties" typically includes:
"Payments of any kind received as consideration for the use of, or the right
to use, any copyright, patent, trademark, design, model, plan, secret formula
or process, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific
experience"

Analysis:
The payment of £[X] for [describe payment] [DOES/DOES NOT] fall within the
treaty definition of royalties because [reasoning].

Important: Treaty definition may be BROADER than UK domestic definition.
Even if not "royalty" under UK law, may be covered by treaty.

2. RESIDENCE - Is recipient treaty resident?

Under the UK-[Country] treaty, [Recipient] must be resident in [Country] for
treaty purposes.

Facts:
• [Recipient] is [incorporated in / tax resident in] [Country]
• [Any relevant facts about residence]

Conclusion: [Recipient] [IS/IS NOT] resident in [Country] for treaty purposes.

3. BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP - Is recipient the beneficial owner?

The beneficial ownership requirement prevents treaty shopping. The recipient
must be the person who has full entitlement to the income.

Key case: Indofood International Finance Ltd v JP Morgan Chase Bank [2006]
- Established that beneficial ownership requires more than bare legal ownership
- Must have full privilege to directly benefit from income

Analysis:
• Is [Recipient] the legal owner of the [debt/IP]? [Yes/No]
• Does [Recipient] have full entitlement to the income? [Yes/No]
• Is [Recipient] acting as agent or conduit for another party? [Yes/No]

[If facts suggest possible conduit arrangement, analyze anti-treaty shopping]

Conclusion: [Recipient] [IS/IS NOT] the beneficial owner because [reasoning].

4. TREATY RATE

Under Article [11/12] of the UK-[Country] treaty:

[Interest - typical provisions]:
"Interest arising in the UK and paid to a resident of [Country] may be taxed
in the UK, but the tax so charged shall not exceed [X]% of the gross amount
of the interest."

OR

"Interest arising in the UK and paid to a resident of [Country] who is the
beneficial owner shall be taxable only in [Country]" (0% withholding)

[State the specific rate from the treaty]

Treaty Rate: [X]% (or 0% if full exemption)

Compare to UK domestic rate: 20%

Treaty provides relief: Reduce withholding from 20% to [X]%

5. CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS

[Check treaty for any special conditions such as]:
• Related party limitations
• Minimum holding periods
• Limitations for specific types of debt/IP
• Substance requirements
• Anti-abuse provisions

[Analyze any relevant conditions]

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CONCLUSION ON TREATY RELIEF:

The UK-[Country] Double Tax Treaty [DOES/DOES NOT] provide relief because:
• Payment falls within treaty definition: [Yes/No]
• Recipient is treaty resident: [Yes/No]
• Recipient is beneficial owner: [Yes/No]
• Conditions met: [Yes/No]

[If treaty applies]:
Treaty reduces withholding rate from 20% (UK domestic) to [X]% (treaty rate).

[If treaty provides full exemption]:
Treaty provides full exemption - payment can be made gross (0% withholding).

### STAGE 4: Withholding Tax Calculation (2-3 marks, 4-5 minutes)

**Template:**

```
WITHHOLDING TAX CALCULATION

Summary of Analysis:
• UK domestic withholding rate: [20% or 0% if exempt]
• Treaty withholding rate: [X%]
• Final applicable rate: [Lower of domestic and treaty]

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CALCULATION:

Gross payment: £[X]

Withholding tax at [rate]%: £[X] × [rate]% = £[Y]

Net payment to recipient: £[X] - £[Y] = £[Z]

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

ALTERNATIVE PRESENTATION (if question asks for gross amount needed):

Net amount required by recipient: £[Z]
Withholding rate: [rate]%

Gross amount calculation (grossing up):
Gross amount = Net amount / (1 - withholding rate)
Gross amount = £[Z] / (1 - [rate]%)
Gross amount = £[Z] / [1-rate as decimal]
Gross amount = £[X]

Proof:
Gross: £[X]
Less withholding ([rate]%): £[Y]
Net received: £[Z] ✓

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SUMMARY TABLE:

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Gross payment | £[X] |
| Withholding tax @ [rate]% | £[Y] |
| Net payment to recipient | £[Z] |
| UK tax withheld by payer | £[Y] |

The payer ([UK company]) must:
• Pay net amount to recipient: £[Z]
• Remit withholding tax to HMRC: £[Y]
• Total cost to payer: £[X]

### STAGE 5: Procedural Requirements and Conclusion (2-3 marks, 4-5 minutes)

**Template:**

```
PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

To obtain treaty relief, certain procedures must be followed:

1. TREATY RELIEF AT SOURCE (HMRC approval):

The UK payer can apply to pay interest/royalties gross (or at reduced rate) if:
• Payer applies to HMRC for approval
• Recipient provides evidence of:
  - Residence in treaty country (certificate of residence)
  - Beneficial ownership of income
  - Claim for treaty relief
• HMRC issues direction to pay gross or at treaty rate

Forms: Recipient completes relevant treaty relief form (varies by treaty)
Process: Submit to HMRC in advance of payment

2. DEDUCT AND RECLAIM:

Alternative procedure:
• UK payer withholds tax at UK domestic rate (20%)
• Recipient claims refund from HMRC afterwards
• Recipient must file claim with:
  - Certificate of residence from home country
  - Evidence of tax withheld (certificate from payer)
  - Completed claim form

This is slower but ensures compliance if treaty position uncertain.

3. DOUBLE TREATY SHOPPING SAFEGUARDS:

Recent treaties include:
• Principal Purpose Test (PPT) - BEPS Action 6
• Limitation on Benefits (LOB) clauses
• Minimum substance requirements

[Analyze if relevant to scenario]

4. COMPLIANCE AND PENALTIES:

If withholding required but not done:
• Payer liable for unpaid tax
• Interest and penalties may apply
• Payer cannot recover from recipient (unless contractual provision)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

APPLICATION TO [PAYMENT]:

Recommended Procedure for [Payer]:

[Option 1 - Treaty Relief at Source]:
• [Recipient] should obtain certificate of residence from [Country] tax authorities
• [Recipient] submits treaty relief application to HMRC (Form [X])
• Once approved, [Payer] can pay gross amount of £[X] with no withholding

Benefits: Recipient receives full amount immediately; no cash flow disadvantage

[Option 2 - Deduct and Reclaim]:
• [Payer] withholds £[Y] and pays net £[Z] to [Recipient]
• [Payer] remits £[Y] to HMRC within [14 days of quarter end]
• [Recipient] claims refund of £[Y - treaty relief] from HMRC
• Refund process: typically [6-12 months]

Benefits: Safer for payer if treaty position uncertain; HMRC approval not required

Recommendation:
Given [facts], [Option 1/Option 2] is preferable because [reasoning].

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CONCLUSION

Summary of Withholding Tax Position:

1. Payment Type: [Interest/Royalty/Dividend]
   Amount: £[X]

2. UK Domestic Withholding:
   [Rate]% = £[Y]
   [If exempt: No withholding required under domestic law]

3. Treaty Relief:
   UK-[Country] DTT Article [X] [reduces rate to [Z]% / provides full exemption]

4. Final Withholding Tax:
   £[Y] (or £[Z] if treaty applies)

5. Net Payment to Recipient:
   £[X - Y] (or £[X - Z])

6. Recommended Procedure:
   [Treaty relief at source / Deduct and reclaim]

Therefore, [Payer] must withhold £[Y] when making the payment, remit this to
HMRC, and pay net £[Z] to [Recipient]. Alternatively, if treaty relief approval
is obtained in advance, [Payer] can pay the gross amount of £[X] with reduced
or no withholding.

## Common Variations and Adaptations

### Variation 1: Multiple Payments (Interest + Royalty)

**If scenario involves more than one payment type:**

```
SEPARATE ANALYSIS REQUIRED

1. Interest Payment: £[X]
   [Analyze interest withholding separately]
   Result: Withholding £[Y]

2. Royalty Payment: £[Z]
   [Analyze royalty withholding separately]
   Result: Withholding £[A]

Total Withholding: £[Y + A]
Total Net Payment: £[X + Z] - £[Y + A]
```

### Variation 2: Back-to-Back Loans / Treaty Shopping

**If facts suggest conduit arrangement:**

```
BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP CONCERN

Facts suggesting possible treaty shopping:
• [Recipient] is special purpose vehicle
• Loan immediately on-lent to third party
• [Recipient] has minimal substance in [Country]
• Ultimate beneficiary is in non-treaty jurisdiction

Analysis:
Under Indofood test, [Recipient] may NOT be beneficial owner if:
• Acting as conduit or agent
• Obligated to pass income to third party
• Has no discretion over income

If NOT beneficial owner:
• Treaty relief DENIED
• UK domestic withholding applies: 20%
• No treaty benefit despite legal residence

This is anti-treaty shopping - HMRC will deny relief if lacks substance.
```

### Variation 3: UK REIT Property Income Distributions

**Specific rules for REITs:**

```
UK REIT - PROPERTY INCOME DISTRIBUTION (PID)

Special withholding tax regime applies:

Domestic Rate: 20% withholding on PIDs to non-UK residents

Treaty Relief: Available under Article 10 (Dividends) in most treaties
• Typically reduces to 0%, 10%, or 15% depending on treaty
• Must follow treaty relief procedures

Note: PIDs are treated differently from ordinary dividends
• Ordinary dividends: No UK withholding
• PIDs: 20% withholding (subject to treaty relief)

Calculation:
PID amount: £[X]
Withholding @ [treaty rate]%: £[Y]
Net distribution: £[X - Y]
```

### Variation 4: EU Interest and Royalties Directive (Historical)

**Note: No longer applies post-Brexit, but may appear in scenarios:**

```
HISTORICAL: EU INTEREST AND ROYALTIES DIRECTIVE

Before Brexit (until 31 December 2020):
• EU I&R Directive provided automatic withholding exemption
• For payments between associated companies in EU
• Conditions: 25%+ shareholding, both companies subject to CT

Post-Brexit:
• Directive no longer applies to UK payments
• Revert to domestic law and DTT provisions
• If question involves pre-2021 scenario, mention Directive

[This shows awareness of recent changes]
```

## Error Prevention Checklist

### Top 10 Mistakes in Withholding Tax Questions

1. **❌ Forgetting quoted Eurobond exemption for interest**
   - ✓ Always check if interest is on listed debt security
   - ✓ This is the most common exemption - don't overlook it

2. **❌ Assuming UK withholds tax on all dividends**
   - ✓ UK does NOT withhold on ordinary dividends (abolished 2016)
   - ✓ Exception: UK REIT PIDs

3. **❌ Using UK definition of royalty for treaty purposes**
   - ✓ Treaty definition is usually BROADER than UK domestic
   - ✓ Analyze under BOTH definitions

4. **❌ Forgetting beneficial ownership test**
   - ✓ ALWAYS analyze whether recipient is beneficial owner
   - ✓ Cite Indofood case
   - ✓ Consider substance and conduit arrangements

5. **❌ Not identifying the specific treaty article**
   - ✓ State "Article 11" (interest) or "Article 12" (royalties)
   - ✓ Show you know treaty structure

6. **❌ Applying wrong withholding rate**
   - ✓ UK domestic = 20% (not 19% or basic rate of IT at time)
   - ✓ Treaty rate varies - read question carefully

7. **❌ Incorrect grossing up calculation**
   - ✓ Gross = Net / (1 - rate), NOT Net × (1 + rate)
   - ✓ Double-check math

8. **❌ Missing procedural requirements**
   - ✓ Explain HOW to claim treaty relief
   - ✓ Certificate of residence required
   - ✓ Two options: relief at source or deduct and reclaim

9. **❌ Not considering UK REIT special rules**
   - ✓ If question mentions REIT, PIDs have different treatment
   - ✓ 20% withholding applies (unlike normal dividends)

10. **❌ Incomplete calculation summary**
    - ✓ Always show: Gross → Less Withholding → Net
    - ✓ State who pays what to whom
    - ✓ Clear summary table helps
