## Answer Structure Template

### 1. Introduction and Issue Identification (2-3 marks, 5 minutes)
```
The key issue is to determine whether [Company Name], a non-UK resident company,
has a permanent establishment (PE) in the UK for corporation tax purposes.

This is critical because:
- If PE exists: UK taxable on profits attributable to the PE
- If no PE: UK tax limited to specific UK-source income (e.g., property income)

[If treaty applicable: The analysis will consider both UK domestic law and the
UK-[Country] Double Taxation Treaty]
```

### 2. UK Domestic Law Analysis (10-12 marks, 15-18 minutes)

#### A. Fixed Place of Business PE (s1141 CTA 2010)

```
Under s1141 CTA 2010, a PE exists where a non-UK resident company carries on
a trade in the UK through a fixed place of business.

Two requirements must be met:
1. Fixed place of business in UK
2. Business is carried on through that fixed place

**Requirement 1: Fixed Place of Business**

Definition: A distinct physical location with degree of permanence.

Examples include:
- Office, branch, factory, workshop ✓
- Mine, oil/gas well, quarry ✓
- Construction site (if sufficient duration) ✓
- Server location (generally NO per HMRC guidance) ✗

Application to scenario:
[Identify all potential fixed places in the facts]

Physical location: [Describe the premises - owned, rented, shared?]
Duration: [How long has it existed/will it exist?]
- General rule: No specific time limit, but >6 months typically indicates permanence
- Construction sites: OECD Model requires >12 months (check treaty)

Degree of permanence: [Analyze whether temporary or permanent]

Conclusion: [Company] does/does not have a fixed place of business because...

**Requirement 2: Business Carried On Through Fixed Place**

Test: Are core business activities conducted through this location?

Application to scenario:
Activities conducted at UK location:
- [List all activities from facts]

For each activity, assess:
- Is it core to the business or merely preparatory/auxiliary?
- Is it essential to profit generation?
- Is it where customer relationships are managed?

Analysis:
[Discuss each activity in detail]

Conclusion: Business is/is not carried on through the fixed place because...

**Overall Fixed Place PE Conclusion:**
[Company] does/does not have a fixed place PE under s1141 CTA 2010.
```

#### B. Preparatory or Auxiliary Activities Exception (s1143 CTA 2010)

```
Even if a fixed place exists and business is carried on through it, no PE arises
if activities are of a preparatory or auxiliary character (s1143 CTA 2010).

Definition: Preparatory/auxiliary activities are those not essential to the
core profit-making activities of the enterprise.

**Classic Preparatory/Auxiliary Activities (Safe):**
✓ Storage, display, or delivery of goods belonging to the enterprise
✓ Maintenance of stock for processing by another enterprise
✓ Maintenance of fixed place solely for purchasing goods or collecting information
✓ Maintenance of fixed place solely for advertising, supply of information,
  scientific research (if preparatory in nature)

**Activities That Are NOT Preparatory/Auxiliary (Create PE):**
✗ Sales activities (even if contracts concluded elsewhere)
✗ Marketing and customer relationship management (core business)
✗ After-sales technical support (if essential to business model)
✗ Product customization or final processing before delivery
✗ Management and coordination of group companies

Application to scenario:
[List activities again and categorize each]

Activity 1: [Name]
- Nature: [Describe]
- Essential to profit-making? [Yes/No with reasoning]
- Conclusion: [Preparatory/auxiliary or core business]

Activity 2: [Name]
- Nature: [Describe]
- Essential to profit-making? [Yes/No with reasoning]
- Conclusion: [Preparatory/auxiliary or core business]

[Continue for all activities]

**Overall Assessment:**
The activities are/are not of preparatory or auxiliary character because...

[If preparatory/auxiliary]: The exception applies - no PE exists despite fixed place.
[If core business]: The exception does not apply - PE exists.
```

#### C. Agency Permanent Establishment (s1143 CTA 2010)

```
Even without a fixed place PE, a PE can arise if a dependent agent habitually
exercises authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the company in the UK.

**Test for Agency PE:**

A person acting in UK creates PE if:
1. Agent has authority to conclude contracts in the name of the company, AND
2. Agent habitually exercises that authority in the UK

Alternative test (less common):
- Agent habitually maintains stock in UK and regularly delivers from that stock
  on behalf of the company

Application to scenario:
[Identify any persons acting for the company in UK]

Agent: [Name/description]

Element 1: Authority to Conclude Contracts
Does [Agent] have authority to:
- Negotiate and finalize contract terms?
- Legally bind the company?
- Or merely solicit orders subject to approval elsewhere?

Analysis:
[Examine agent's actual powers - legal authority vs. practical reality]

Conclusion: [Agent] does/does not have authority to conclude contracts.

Element 2: Habitual Exercise
Is the authority exercised regularly and repeatedly?
- Frequency: [How often?]
- Pattern: [Regular or occasional?]

Conclusion: Authority is/is not habitually exercised.

**Independent Agent Exception:**

Even if above conditions met, no PE if agent is independent and acting in
ordinary course of their business.

Is [Agent] independent?
Factors:
- Legal independence: Separate legal entity? ✓/✗
- Economic independence: Multiple principals? Financially dependent on company? ✓/✗
- Operational independence: Subject to company's detailed instructions? ✓/✗

Analysis:
[Apply factors to facts]

Conclusion: [Agent] is/is not an independent agent.

**Agency PE Conclusion:**
[Company] does/does not have an agency PE through [Agent].
```

### 3. Double Tax Treaty Analysis (if applicable) (5-7 marks, 8-10 minutes)

```
Where a double tax treaty exists, the treaty definition of PE prevails over
domestic law (s6 CTA 2010).

The UK-[Country] DTT follows the OECD Model Tax Convention Article 5.

**Article 5(1): Basic Definition**

"Permanent establishment" means a fixed place of business through which the
business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on.

[Apply same analysis as domestic law above, but reference treaty article]

**Article 5(2): Specific Inclusions**

The term specifically includes:
- Place of management
- Branch, office, factory, workshop
- Mine, oil/gas well, quarry or other place of extraction of natural resources
- [Check if treaty includes construction sites: typically >12 months]

Application: [Does the situation fall within specific inclusions?]

**Article 5(3): Construction Sites (if applicable)**

Building site or construction/installation project constitutes PE only if it
lasts more than [12] months (check specific treaty).

Application to scenario:
Duration: [X months]
Start date: [Date]
Expected completion: [Date]

Conclusion: Construction site does/does not exceed threshold.

**Article 5(4): Exclusions (Preparatory/Auxiliary)**

PE does not include a fixed place used solely for:
a) Storage, display or delivery of goods belonging to enterprise
b) Maintenance of stock solely for storage, display or delivery
c) Maintenance of stock solely for processing by another enterprise
d) Purchasing goods or collecting information
e) Advertising, supply of information, scientific research
f) Any combination of above

[Apply same preparatory/auxiliary analysis as domestic law]

**Article 5(5): Dependent Agent PE**

PE exists where person (other than independent agent) acts on behalf of
enterprise and:
- Has and habitually exercises authority to conclude contracts in enterprise's name, OR
- [Some treaties include]: Has no such authority but habitually maintains stock
  and regularly delivers on behalf of enterprise

[Apply same agency analysis as domestic law]

**Article 5(6): Independent Agent Exception**

No PE where enterprise carries on business through broker, general commission
agent or other independent agent, provided acting in ordinary course of business.

[Apply independence test]

**Treaty PE Conclusion:**
Under the UK-[Country] DTT, [Company] does/does not have a PE in the UK.
```

### 4. Attribution of Profits to PE (if PE exists) (3-5 marks, 7-10 minutes)

```
If a PE exists, UK corporation tax applies to profits attributable to the PE.

**Attribution Principles:**

Under Article 7 OECD Model (Authorised OECD Approach) and UK domestic law:
- Treat PE as separate and independent enterprise
- Attribute profits that PE would have made dealing at arm's length
- Apply transfer pricing principles

**Key Considerations:**

1. **Assets:** What assets are attributable to the PE?
   [List assets - property, equipment, inventory, IP rights]

2. **Functions:** What functions does the PE perform?
   [Describe functions - sales, marketing, customer support, etc.]

3. **Risks:** What risks does the PE assume?
   [Identify risks - market risk, credit risk, inventory risk]

4. **Income:** What income should be attributed?
   Application to scenario:
   - Sales revenue from UK customers: [Amount/method]
   - Service fees: [Amount/method]
   - Allocation of head office costs: [Approach]

5. **Deductions:** What expenses are deductible?
   - Direct costs of PE operations: [List]
   - Allocation of head office expenses: [Reasonable basis]
   - Interest on notional funding: [If applicable]

**Calculation (if figures provided):**

[Provide computation showing:
- Revenue attributable to PE
- Less: Direct costs
- Less: Allocated head office costs
- Less: Notional interest (if applicable)
- = Profits attributable to PE
- = UK CT liability at 25% (or 19% if small profits)]

**Key Points:**
- No deduction for royalties/interest paid to head office (part of same legal entity)
- Must apply arm's length principle
- Consider OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines
```

### 5. Tax Consequences and Recommendations (2-4 marks, 5-7 minutes)

```
**If PE Exists:**

UK Corporation Tax Position:
- [Company] subject to UK CT on profits attributable to the PE
- Rate: 25% (main rate) or 19% (if profits <£50,000)
- Filing: CT return required (Form CT600)
- Payment: 9 months + 1 day after end of accounting period

Compliance Requirements:
- Register for UK corporation tax
- Appoint UK tax representative (if no UK-resident director)
- Keep UK-specific accounting records
- Prepare PE-specific financial statements
- Transfer pricing documentation
- Annual filing obligations

Treaty Relief:
- Foreign tax credit available in [home country] for UK tax paid
- Elimination of double taxation under Article 23 of DTT

**If No PE:**

Limited UK Tax Exposure:
- No UK CT on business profits
- Only specific UK-source income taxed (e.g., UK property income, certain interest)
- No UK filing obligations (unless withholding tax applies)

**Planning Recommendations:**

1. If seeking to avoid PE:
   - Ensure agents are independent and not habitually concluding contracts
   - Limit UK activities to preparatory/auxiliary functions
   - Avoid fixed places or ensure strictly storage/display only
   - Hold contract negotiations/conclusions outside UK

2. If PE unavoidable or desired:
   - Ensure proper transfer pricing documentation
   - Consider formal branch registration
   - Implement robust accounting systems for profit attribution
   - Monitor OECD BEPS developments

3. Uncertain cases:
   - Consider advance clearance from HMRC
   - Document fact pattern and analysis
   - Review treaty position carefully
   - Monitor substance requirements
```

### 6. Conclusion (1-2 marks, 2-3 minutes)

```
In conclusion, [Company] does/does not have a permanent establishment in the UK.

[If PE exists]:
This is because [summarize key reason - fixed place PE / agency PE / treaty PE].
As a result, [Company] is subject to UK corporation tax on profits attributable
to the PE, estimated at [£X] based on the facts provided.

[If no PE]:
This is because [summarize key reason - no fixed place / preparatory-auxiliary
exception / independent agent / treaty protection]. As a result, [Company] has
limited UK tax exposure, restricted to specific UK-source income.

[Recommendations if appropriate]
```
