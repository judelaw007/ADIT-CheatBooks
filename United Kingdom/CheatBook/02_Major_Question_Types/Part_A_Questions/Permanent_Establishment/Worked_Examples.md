## EXAMPLE 1: Fixed Place PE with Preparatory/Auxiliary Issues

### Question (25 marks, 45 minutes)

**TechCorp Inc**, a company incorporated and tax resident in the United States, develops and sells enterprise software solutions. TechCorp has no operations in the UK except for the following:

1. **London Office (Rented)**: TechCorp rents office space in London, which it has occupied for 18 months. The office houses:
   - 5 full-time employees who provide technical support to UK and European customers
   - 2 employees responsible for marketing and organizing product demonstrations
   - 1 office manager handling administration

2. **Activities performed in London**:
   - Technical support is provided via phone, email, and occasional on-site visits
   - Product demonstrations are conducted at customer premises or at the London office
   - Marketing employees attend conferences and network with potential customers
   - All sales contracts are negotiated by the London team, but final contracts are signed by TechCorp's head office in New York after review
   - The London office collects market intelligence and customer feedback for product development

3. **Warehouse in Birmingham**: TechCorp rents a warehouse where it stores software documentation, promotional materials, and some hardware devices (servers that customers can purchase). The warehouse is staffed by 2 employees who:
   - Manage inventory
   - Ship materials to customers upon orders received from head office
   - Do not have authority to sell or negotiate sales

The UK-USA Double Tax Treaty follows the OECD Model Convention.

**Required:**
Advise whether TechCorp Inc has a permanent establishment in the UK for UK corporation tax purposes.

---

### SUGGESTED ANSWER

#### 1. Introduction and Issue Identification

The key issue is to determine whether TechCorp Inc, a US-resident company, has a permanent establishment (PE) in the UK for corporation tax purposes.

This is critical because:
- If a PE exists, TechCorp will be subject to UK corporation tax on profits attributable to the PE
- If no PE exists, UK tax exposure is limited to specific UK-source income

The analysis will consider:
- UK domestic law (ss1141-1143 CTA 2010)
- The UK-USA Double Tax Treaty (following OECD Model Article 5)

Since a treaty exists, the treaty definition will override domestic law if there is any conflict (s6 CTA 2010).

**[Marks: 2-3]**

---

#### 2. UK Domestic Law Analysis

##### A. Fixed Place of Business PE - London Office (s1141 CTA 2010)

Under s1141 CTA 2010, a PE exists where a non-UK resident company carries on a trade in the UK through a fixed place of business. Two requirements must be met:

**Requirement 1: Fixed Place of Business**

TechCorp rents office space in London which it has occupied for 18 months. This clearly constitutes a fixed place of business because:
- It is an identifiable physical location (rented office)
- It has a degree of permanence (18 months well exceeds the typical 6-month indicator)
- The fact that premises are rented rather than owned is irrelevant

**Conclusion:** TechCorp has a fixed place of business in the UK (the London office).

**Requirement 2: Business Carried On Through Fixed Place**

The London office conducts several activities:
1. Technical support to customers (phone, email, on-site visits)
2. Marketing and product demonstrations
3. Sales contract negotiation (but not conclusion)
4. Market intelligence gathering
5. Administrative functions

To determine if "business is carried on," I must assess whether these activities are core business functions or merely preparatory/auxiliary (analyzed below).

Prima facie, technical support and marketing are core business activities for a software company, as they are essential to maintaining customer relationships and generating revenue.

**Preliminary Conclusion:** Business is carried on through the London office, subject to the preparatory/auxiliary exception analysis.

**[Marks: 3-4]**

---

##### B. Preparatory or Auxiliary Exception (s1143 CTA 2010)

Even if a fixed place exists and business is carried on, no PE arises if activities are of a preparatory or auxiliary character (s1143 CTA 2010).

Preparatory/auxiliary activities are those not essential to the core profit-making activities of the enterprise. Safe harbor activities include storage, display, delivery, purchasing, and information gathering.

**Analysis of Each Activity:**

**1. Technical Support**
- Nature: Post-sales customer support for enterprise software
- Essential to profit-making? **YES**
  - For software companies, ongoing technical support is crucial to customer retention
  - Enterprise software sales typically include support agreements
  - Without support, customers would not purchase or would switch to competitors
- **Conclusion:** Technical support is a **core business activity**, NOT preparatory/auxiliary

**2. Marketing and Product Demonstrations**
- Nature: Promoting products and demonstrating functionality to potential customers
- Essential to profit-making? **YES**
  - Directly leads to sales generation
  - Product demonstrations are critical for enterprise software sales
  - Marketing activities generate leads and customer relationships
- **Conclusion:** Marketing is a **core business activity**, NOT preparatory/auxiliary

**3. Sales Contract Negotiation**
- Nature: Negotiating terms with customers (though contracts concluded in US)
- Essential to profit-making? **YES**
  - Negotiation is substantive part of sales process
  - Even though formal signing occurs in US, the negotiation in UK is value-creating
- **Conclusion:** Sales negotiation is a **core business activity**, NOT preparatory/auxiliary

**4. Market Intelligence Gathering**
- Nature: Collecting customer feedback for product development
- Essential to profit-making? **BORDERLINE**
  - This could be considered preparatory (research/information gathering - s1143(4)(d))
  - However, in context of other core activities, it's ancillary to main operations
- **Conclusion:** This activity alone might be preparatory, but in combination with other core activities, the overall character is NOT preparatory/auxiliary

**5. Administrative Functions**
- Nature: Office management, administration
- Essential to profit-making? **NO**
  - Purely administrative - supporting the other functions
  - However, presence of admin alongside core functions doesn't change overall conclusion

**Overall Assessment:**

The activities conducted at the London office are predominantly **core business activities** essential to TechCorp's profit-making. Technical support and marketing are not merely preparatory or auxiliary - they are substantive business functions critical to customer acquisition and retention.

The preparatory/auxiliary exception does **NOT** apply.

**Conclusion:** TechCorp has a **fixed place PE** in the UK through its London office.

**[Marks: 4-5]**

##### C. Fixed Place of Business PE - Birmingham Warehouse (s1141 CTA 2010)

**Requirement 1: Fixed Place of Business**

The Birmingham warehouse is a rented facility that constitutes a fixed place of business (identifiable location with degree of permanence).

**Requirement 2: Business Carried On & Preparatory/Auxiliary Exception**

Activities at the warehouse:
- Storage of software documentation, promotional materials, and hardware
- Inventory management
- Shipping materials to customers upon head office orders
- No sales or negotiation authority

**Analysis:**

These activities fall squarely within the **preparatory/auxiliary safe harbor** under s1143 CTA 2010:
- **s1143(4)(a)**: "facilities for storage, display or delivery of goods"
- The warehouse employees do not sell or negotiate
- They merely fulfill orders initiated elsewhere
- This is classic "storage and delivery" activity

**Conclusion:** The Birmingham warehouse does **NOT** create a PE due to the preparatory/auxiliary exception.

**[Marks: 2-3]**

---

##### D. Agency Permanent Establishment (s1143 CTA 2010)

For completeness, I will consider whether the London employees create an agency PE.

Under s1143, a PE can arise where a person acts on behalf of the enterprise and habitually exercises authority to conclude contracts.

**Application:**

The London employees:
- Negotiate sales contracts
- **Do NOT** have authority to conclude contracts (final signing by US head office)

**Conclusion:** The employees do not have authority to conclude contracts. They solicit orders subject to head office approval. This does **NOT** create an agency PE.

**Note:** However, the fixed place PE already exists through the London office, so this is somewhat academic.

**[Marks: 1-2]**

---

#### 3. Double Tax Treaty Analysis (UK-USA DTT - Article 5 OECD Model)

Since the UK-USA DTT applies, the treaty definition prevails (s6 CTA 2010).

##### Article 5(1): Basic Definition

"Permanent establishment" means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on.

**Application:**
- London office = fixed place of business ✓
- Business carried on through it (technical support, marketing) ✓
- **Conclusion:** PE exists under Article 5(1)

##### Article 5(2): Specific Inclusions

The term specifically includes "office" - the London office clearly qualifies.

##### Article 5(4): Preparatory/Auxiliary Exclusions

Article 5(4) provides exclusions similar to s1143:
- Storage, display, delivery (paragraph a-b)
- Purchasing, information gathering (paragraph d)
- Advertising, information supply (paragraph e)

**London Office:** As analyzed above, the activities are NOT preparatory/auxiliary. Article 5(4) does NOT apply.

**Birmingham Warehouse:** Activities are purely storage and delivery - Article 5(4)(a) applies. No PE.

##### Article 5(5): Dependent Agent PE

Similar to domestic law analysis - employees do not conclude contracts. No agency PE under Article 5(5).

**Treaty Conclusion:**

Under the UK-USA DTT Article 5, TechCorp has a PE in the UK through its **London office** but NOT through the Birmingham warehouse.

**[Marks: 3-4]**

#### 4. Attribution of Profits to PE

Having established a PE exists (the London office), UK corporation tax applies to profits attributable to that PE.

##### Functional Analysis

**Assets:** Office equipment, computers, potentially software licenses

**Functions performed by London PE:**
- Technical support to UK/European customers
- Marketing and lead generation
- Sales negotiation
- Market intelligence

**Risks:** Customer retention risk, market reputation risk

##### Profit Attribution Approach

Under Article 7 OECD Model and UK domestic law (s20-21 CTA 2009), the PE should be treated as a functionally separate entity dealing at arm's length with head office.

**Revenue Attribution:**
- Support fees from UK/European customers serviced by London team
- Portion of sales revenue from customers where London PE conducted negotiation and support
- Apply apportionment based on functions performed

**Deductible Costs:**
- Salaries of 8 London employees
- Rent for London office
- Direct operating expenses
- Allocated head office costs (R&D, general management) on reasonable basis
- Notional interest on capital supporting PE operations

**Example Calculation (illustrative):**

Assuming revenue attributable to PE of £2,000,000:

```
Revenue from customers serviced by UK PE       £2,000,000
Less: Direct costs
  - Employee salaries (8 staff)                  (£600,000)
  - Office rent                                   (£80,000)
  - Operating expenses                            (£120,000)
Less: Allocated head office costs
  - Share of R&D costs                           (£200,000)
  - Share of management costs                     (£100,000)
Less: Notional interest on capital               (£50,000)
                                                -----------
Taxable profit of PE                             £850,000
                                                ===========

UK Corporation Tax @ 25%                         £212,500
```

**[Marks: 3-4]**

---

#### 5. Tax Consequences and Recommendations

##### UK Corporation Tax Position

TechCorp is subject to UK corporation tax on profits attributable to the London PE:
- Tax rate: 25% (main rate) as profits exceed £250,000
- Accounting period: Follows TechCorp's financial year
- Payment due: 9 months and 1 day after end of accounting period

##### Compliance Requirements

TechCorp must:
1. Register for UK corporation tax
2. Appoint a UK tax representative or ensure UK-resident director
3. File annual CT600 return
4. Prepare UK PE-specific accounts
5. Maintain transfer pricing documentation for profit attribution
6. Potentially register for VAT if taxable supplies in UK

##### Treaty Relief

TechCorp can claim foreign tax credit in the US for UK corporation tax paid on PE profits, eliminating double taxation (Article 23 UK-USA DTT).

##### Planning Recommendations

**If TechCorp wishes to avoid PE:**
1. **Restructure London operations** to purely preparatory/auxiliary activities:
   - Limit to market research and information gathering only
   - Relocate technical support outside UK
   - Ensure no sales negotiation in UK

2. **Establish UK subsidiary** instead:
   - Formal UK company to provide services
   - Arm's length service agreement with TechCorp
   - Greater flexibility but full UK corporation tax on subsidiary profits

**If TechCorp accepts PE:**
- Ensure robust transfer pricing documentation
- Implement clear profit attribution methodology
- Maintain compliance with UK filing deadlines

**[Marks: 3-4]**

---

#### 6. Conclusion

TechCorp Inc **has a permanent establishment** in the UK through its London office.

This is because:
1. The London office is a fixed place of business (rented premises for 18 months)
2. Core business activities are carried on through it (technical support and marketing)
3. These activities are NOT preparatory/auxiliary - they are essential to TechCorp's profit-making
4. The UK-USA DTT confirms PE status under Article 5

The Birmingham warehouse does NOT create a separate PE as its activities are purely storage and delivery (preparatory/auxiliary exception applies).

As a result, TechCorp is subject to UK corporation tax on profits attributable to the London PE. Based on illustrative figures, this could result in UK tax liability of approximately £212,500.

TechCorp should ensure full UK tax compliance and consider restructuring options if seeking to eliminate the PE.

### COMMON ERRORS TO AVOID

**❌ ERROR 1:** Assuming the Birmingham warehouse creates a PE
- ✅ **Correct:** Pure storage/delivery falls under preparatory/auxiliary exception

**❌ ERROR 2:** Concluding technical support is preparatory/auxiliary
- ✅ **Correct:** For software companies, ongoing support is core business

**❌ ERROR 3:** Treating market intelligence as core business in isolation
- ✅ **Correct:** It's preparatory, but overall character of London office is core business

**❌ ERROR 4:** Creating agency PE when employees don't conclude contracts
- ✅ **Correct:** Negotiation without authority to conclude ≠ agency PE

**❌ ERROR 5:** Forgetting to attribute profits once PE established
- ✅ **Correct:** Always discuss profit attribution if PE exists

---

### KEY LESSONS

1. **Preparatory/Auxiliary is narrowly interpreted** - technical support and marketing are almost always core business

2. **Each location must be analyzed separately** - London office and Birmingham warehouse have different characteristics

3. **Overall character test** - even if some activities are preparatory, the overall character of the fixed place determines PE status

4. **Authority to conclude contracts is key** for agency PE - negotiation alone is insufficient

5. **Always complete the analysis** - don't stop at PE conclusion; discuss profit attribution

6. **Treaty follows OECD Model** - familiarity with Article 5 is essential

## EXAMPLE 2: Construction PE and Agency Issues

### Question (25 marks, 45 minutes)

**BuildGlobal SA**, a company incorporated and tax resident in France, specializes in large-scale construction projects. BuildGlobal has been awarded a contract to construct a hospital in Manchester, UK.

**Project Details:**
- Contract signed: 1 April 2024
- Site preparation commenced: 15 May 2024
- Construction commenced: 1 July 2024
- Expected completion: 31 August 2025
- Total project duration: 16 months (from construction commencement)

**Personnel and Activities:**
- BuildGlobal has 30 employees working on-site in Manchester
- A site office (portacabin) is maintained for project management
- All construction activities are supervised by BuildGlobal's project manager (French resident)
- Major contracts with sub-contractors are negotiated on-site but formally signed by BuildGlobal's Paris head office
- Equipment and materials are stored on-site

**Sales Agent:**
- BuildGlobal has appointed **UK Services Ltd**, a UK company, as its exclusive agent in the UK
- UK Services Ltd actively markets BuildGlobal's services to potential UK clients
- UK Services Ltd has authority to negotiate contract terms and has successfully concluded three contracts binding BuildGlobal (signed in UK Services' name "on behalf of BuildGlobal")
- BuildGlobal pays UK Services Ltd a commission of 8% of contract value
- UK Services Ltd also acts as agent for two other European construction companies

The UK-France Double Tax Treaty follows the OECD Model Convention and includes the standard 12-month construction site rule.

**Required:**
Advise whether BuildGlobal SA has a permanent establishment in the UK.

---

### SUGGESTED ANSWER

#### 1. Introduction and Issue Identification

The key issue is to determine whether BuildGlobal SA, a French-resident company, has a permanent establishment (PE) in the UK for UK corporation tax purposes.

BuildGlobal may have a PE through:
1. The construction site in Manchester (construction PE)
2. UK Services Ltd acting as agent (agency PE)

This is critical as a PE would subject BuildGlobal to UK corporation tax on profits attributable to the PE.

The analysis will consider:
- UK domestic law (ss1141-1143 CTA 2010)
- UK-France Double Tax Treaty (following OECD Model, particularly Article 5(3) on construction sites)

**[Marks: 2-3]**

---

#### 2. UK Domestic Law Analysis - Construction Site

##### A. Fixed Place of Business PE (s1141 CTA 2010)

**Requirement 1: Fixed Place of Business**

The Manchester construction site constitutes a fixed place of business:
- Identifiable physical location (hospital construction site)
- Site office (portacabin) maintained
- On-site equipment and materials storage
- Duration: 16 months from construction commencement - substantial permanence

**Conclusion:** Fixed place of business exists.

**Requirement 2: Business Carried On Through Fixed Place**

BuildGlobal's core business is construction. The following activities occur on-site:
- Actual construction work (30 employees)
- Project management and supervision
- Sub-contractor coordination
- Equipment and materials management

These are undoubtedly core business activities - this is where BuildGlobal's profit-making construction activities occur.

**Conclusion:** Business is carried on through the fixed place.

**Preparatory/Auxiliary Exception:**

Construction work is the essence of BuildGlobal's business. It is clearly NOT preparatory or auxiliary - it is the main profit-generating activity.

The preparatory/auxiliary exception does NOT apply.

**Domestic Law Conclusion:** BuildGlobal has a fixed place PE through the Manchester construction site under s1141 CTA 2010.

**[Marks: 4-5]**

---

#### 3. Treaty Analysis - Construction Site (Article 5(3))

The UK-France DTT follows the OECD Model and includes Article 5(3) on construction sites.

##### Article 5(3): Building Site/Construction PE

Article 5(3) provides that a building site or construction or installation project constitutes a PE **only if it lasts more than 12 months**.

This is a specific rule for construction projects that may differ from the general fixed place PE rule.

**Duration Calculation:**

**Key Question:** When does the clock start?

OECD Commentary indicates that the period starts when the enterprise **begins its activities in connection with the construction project**, which typically means when **physical construction activities commence**.

**Timeline:**
- Contract signed: 1 April 2024 (planning/legal - NOT counted)
- Site preparation: 15 May 2024 (arguably start, but typically preparatory)
- Construction commencement: 1 July 2024 (physical construction - **START**)
- Expected completion: 31 August 2025

**Duration:** 1 July 2024 to 31 August 2025 = **14 months**

**Analysis:**

14 months exceeds the 12-month threshold in Article 5(3).

**However**, there is some uncertainty:
- If the clock starts from site preparation (15 May 2024), duration = 15.5 months - clearly exceeds 12 months
- If the clock starts from construction commencement (1 July 2024), duration = 14 months - still exceeds 12 months

**Conservative conclusion:** The construction site **exceeds 12 months** under Article 5(3).

**Treaty Conclusion:** BuildGlobal has a PE in the UK through the Manchester construction site under Article 5(3) of the UK-France DTT.

**[Marks: 4-5]**

---

#### 4. Agency Permanent Establishment Analysis

Even if the construction site PE did not exist (or separately from it), a PE may arise through UK Services Ltd acting as BuildGlobal's agent.

##### UK Domestic Law - s1143 CTA 2010

Under s1143, a PE exists where a person acts on behalf of the enterprise and habitually exercises authority to conclude contracts.

**Element 1: Authority to Conclude Contracts**

UK Services Ltd has authority to:
- Negotiate contract terms ✓
- Conclude contracts binding on BuildGlobal ✓
- Contracts are signed in UK Services' name "on behalf of BuildGlobal" ✓

This is clear authority to conclude contracts - the agent legally binds the principal (BuildGlobal).

**Conclusion:** Authority exists.

**Element 2: Habitually Exercises Authority**

UK Services Ltd has successfully concluded **three contracts** binding BuildGlobal.

"Habitually" means regularly and repeatedly. Three contracts indicates a pattern, not a one-off occurrence, especially given the context of large construction projects (not high-volume transactions).

**Conclusion:** Authority is habitually exercised.

**Element 3: Independent Agent Exception**

Even if the above conditions are met, no PE arises if UK Services Ltd is an independent agent acting in the ordinary course of its business.

**Factors indicating independence:**

| Factor | Analysis | Independent? |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Legal** | UK Services Ltd is a separate UK company | ✓ Yes |
| **Economic** | Acts for **two other** European construction companies (not exclusive economically) | ✓ Yes |
| **Commission** | Paid 8% commission (market rate for commission agents) | ✓ Yes |
| **Control** | No indication of detailed control by BuildGlobal | ✓ Probably yes |

**Assessment:**

UK Services Ltd appears to be **legally and economically independent**:
- Separate legal entity
- Multiple principals (BuildGlobal plus two others)
- Acts for commission (typical agent structure)
- No indication of subordination or detailed control

**Is UK Services Ltd acting "in the ordinary course of its business"?**

Yes - UK Services Ltd's business is acting as agent for construction companies. This is exactly its ordinary business activity.

**Conclusion:** UK Services Ltd qualifies as an **independent agent**.

**Domestic Law Conclusion:** Due to the independent agent exception, UK Services Ltd does **NOT** create an agency PE.

**[Marks: 5-6]**

---

##### Treaty Analysis - Article 5(5) and 5(6)

**Article 5(5): Dependent Agent**

Similar to domestic law, Article 5(5) creates PE where a person has and habitually exercises authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise.

As analyzed, UK Services Ltd has and habitually exercises such authority.

**Article 5(6): Independent Agent Exception**

Article 5(6) provides that Article 5(5) does not apply where the agent is a broker, general commission agent, or other agent of independent status acting in the ordinary course of business.

**However**, Article 5(6) adds: "**provided that such persons are not devoted wholly or almost wholly to that enterprise**."

**Key Question:** Is UK Services Ltd "devoted wholly or almost wholly" to BuildGlobal?

**Analysis:**
- UK Services Ltd acts for **two other** construction companies in addition to BuildGlobal
- It is not devoted "wholly" to BuildGlobal (clearly acts for others)
- Is it devoted "almost wholly" to BuildGlobal?
  - This depends on facts not provided (revenue split, time allocation)
  - If BuildGlobal represents >80-90% of UK Services' business, might be "almost wholly"
  - But acting for two other principals suggests meaningful diversification

**Assuming UK Services Ltd is not devoted almost wholly to BuildGlobal** (reasonable assumption given multiple principals):

UK Services Ltd qualifies as an independent agent under Article 5(6).

**Treaty Conclusion:** UK Services Ltd does **NOT** create an agency PE under Article 5(5)/(6).

**Note:** If facts showed UK Services Ltd was devoted almost wholly to BuildGlobal (e.g., 90%+ of revenue), the independent agent exception would fail and an agency PE would exist.

**[Marks: 3-4]**

#### 5. Attribution of Profits to PE (Construction Site)

BuildGlobal has a PE through the Manchester construction site. UK corporation tax applies to profits attributable to that PE.

##### Functional Analysis

**Assets:** Construction equipment, site office, materials

**Functions:** Complete hospital construction project

**Risks:** Project completion risk, sub-contractor risk, safety/liability risk

##### Profit Attribution

Under the functionally separate entity approach (Article 7 OECD Model, s20-21 CTA 2009):

The PE should be attributed the profit it would have made as an independent contractor performing the same construction project.

**Approach for Construction Projects:**

Typically use **percentage of completion method** or **contract profit margin** method.

**Illustrative Calculation:**

Assuming total contract value of £10,000,000 and construction industry arm's length profit margin of 8%:

```
Contract revenue (Manchester hospital)          £10,000,000

Less: Direct costs
  - Materials                                    (£4,500,000)
  - Sub-contractors                              (£3,000,000)
  - Labour (30 employees)                        (£1,200,000)
  - Equipment costs                                (£400,000)
  - Site costs                                     (£150,000)
Less: Allocated head office costs                  (£250,000)
                                                 ------------
Taxable profit of PE                               £500,000
                                                 ============

UK Corporation Tax @ 25%                           £125,000
```

Alternatively, applying 8% margin to £10m contract = £800,000 profit (cross-check reasonableness).

**[Marks: 3-4]**

---

#### 6. Tax Consequences

##### UK Corporation Tax Position

BuildGlobal is subject to UK corporation tax on profits from the Manchester construction PE:
- Tax rate: 25% (or 19% if small profits)
- Tax liability estimated at £125,000 (based on illustrative calculation)

##### Compliance Requirements

- Register for UK corporation tax
- File annual CT600 returns
- Prepare PE-specific accounts
- Maintain records in UK (or readily accessible)
- Potentially register for VAT (construction services)
- CIS (Construction Industry Scheme) compliance - deduction from payments to sub-contractors

##### Treaty Relief

BuildGlobal can claim credit in France for UK tax paid, eliminating double taxation (Article 23 UK-France DTT).

##### Duration Consideration

The PE exists only for the duration of the construction project (16 months). Once the project completes (31 August 2025), the PE ceases, and UK tax obligations end (subject to final return).

**[Marks: 2-3]**

---

#### 7. Conclusion

BuildGlobal SA **has a permanent establishment** in the UK through its Manchester construction site.

This is because:
- The construction site is a fixed place of business lasting 14 months
- This exceeds the 12-month threshold in Article 5(3) of the UK-France DTT
- Construction activities are core business operations, not preparatory/auxiliary

BuildGlobal does **NOT** have an additional PE through UK Services Ltd because:
- Although UK Services Ltd concludes contracts on BuildGlobal's behalf
- It qualifies as an independent agent acting in ordinary course of business
- It is not devoted wholly or almost wholly to BuildGlobal (acts for multiple principals)

As a result, BuildGlobal is subject to UK corporation tax on profits from the Manchester project, estimated at approximately £125,000. BuildGlobal should ensure full compliance with UK tax and construction industry regulations during the project duration.

### COMMON ERRORS TO AVOID

**❌ ERROR 1:** Starting construction PE clock from contract signing date
- ✅ **Correct:** Clock starts when physical construction activities commence

**❌ ERROR 2:** Assuming any agent creates PE
- ✅ **Correct:** Independent agent exception applies if genuinely independent

**❌ ERROR 3:** Overlooking "devoted wholly or almost wholly" test in Article 5(6)
- ✅ **Correct:** Must assess whether agent is substantially devoted to one principal

**❌ ERROR 4:** Forgetting construction-specific compliance (CIS)
- ✅ **Correct:** Construction industry has special tax deduction scheme in UK

**❌ ERROR 5:** Assuming construction PE is permanent
- ✅ **Correct:** PE ceases when project completes

### KEY LESSONS

1. **Construction sites have special treaty rules** - Always check Article 5(3) and specific treaty threshold (6, 12, or 18 months)

2. **Duration calculation is critical** - Start from physical construction commencement, not contract signing

3. **Independent agent exception is fact-specific** - Analyze legal, economic, and operational independence

4. **Multiple principals strengthen independence** - Agent acting for several enterprises is more likely to be independent

5. **Article 5(6) "devoted wholly or almost wholly" test** - Can defeat independence if agent substantially dedicated to one principal

6. **Construction projects need special compliance attention** - CIS, VAT, health & safety regulations

## PRACTICE EXERCISES

### Quick Questions (Self-Test)

1. Does a server located in the UK create a PE for a foreign e-commerce company?
   **Answer:** Generally NO (per HMRC guidance INTM267360) - server alone not sufficient

2. Can rented premises constitute a "fixed place of business"?

   **Answer:** More than 12 months (but check specific treaty - may vary)

4. Is a warehouse used purely for storage a PE?
   **Answer:** Generally NO - preparatory/auxiliary exception applies (s1143)

5. Does an agent who solicits orders (but doesn't conclude contracts) create agency PE?
   **Answer:** NO - must have authority to conclude contracts
