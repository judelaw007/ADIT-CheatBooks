# Part A: Permanent Establishment - KEY POINTS

## Quick Reference Guide

This document provides essential rules, thresholds, and key points for PE questions. Use this as a rapid refresher before the exam.

---

## WHAT IS A PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT (PE)?

**Definition:** A taxable presence of a non-UK resident company in the UK, creating UK corporation tax liability on profits attributable to that PE.

**Why It Matters:**
- **With PE**: UK taxable on profits attributable to PE
- **Without PE**: UK tax limited to specific UK-source income (property, certain royalties/interest)

---

## UK DOMESTIC LAW - PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT

### Legislation
- **s1141-1143 CTA 2010**: PE definition
- **s19 CTA 2009**: CT charge on non-residents with UK PE
- **s20-21 CTA 2009**: Profits attributable to PE

---

## 1. FIXED PLACE OF BUSINESS PE (s1141 CTA 2010)

### Requirements (Both Must Be Met)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Fixed place of business in UK       │
│            AND                           │
│  2. Business carried on through it      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Element 1: Fixed Place of Business

**Definition:** Distinct physical location with degree of permanence

**Examples That ARE Fixed Places:**
✓ Office, branch, factory, workshop
✓ Mine, oil well, gas well, quarry
✓ Construction site (if sufficient duration)
✓ Warehouse (if not merely storage - see exception below)
✓ Rented premises (ownership not required)
✓ Shared office space (if identifiable location)

**Examples That Are NOT Fixed Places:**
✗ Server/website (per HMRC guidance INTM267360)
✗ Presence of employees alone (without fixed location)
✗ Purely temporary presence (< 6 months typically)
✗ Equipment at customer's premises (unless enterprise's fixed place)

**Duration Requirement:**
- No specific time limit in UK domestic law
- General guidance: >6 months indicates permanence
- <6 months: Case-by-case assessment
- Construction sites: See treaty provisions (typically 12 months)

**Key Case:** **Tariff Fabrik v Harpener** - emphasis on permanence and identifiable location

### Element 2: Business Carried On Through Fixed Place

**Test:** Are substantive business activities conducted at the location?

**What Counts:**
✓ Sales activities
✓ Customer relationship management
✓ After-sales service and technical support
✓ Marketing and business development
✓ Final processing/customization of products
✓ Management and coordination functions

**What Doesn't Count (See Preparatory/Auxiliary Exception):**
✗ Pure storage or display
✗ Information gathering or market research
✗ Purchasing activities only
✗ Administrative functions with no customer interface

---

## 2. PREPARATORY OR AUXILIARY EXCEPTION (s1143 CTA 2010)

### The Exception

**Even if a fixed place exists**, NO PE if activities are of **preparatory or auxiliary character**.

### Safe Harbor Activities (Preparatory/Auxiliary)

Activities that will NOT create PE:

| Activity | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Storage, display, delivery** | Warehouse storing goods for delivery by third party |
| **Stock for processing by another** | Holding raw materials for collection by manufacturer |
| **Purchasing goods or collecting info** | Procurement office gathering market intelligence |
| **Advertising, information supply** | Marketing liaison office (no customer sales) |
| **Scientific research** | R&D facility (if preparatory to business) |

**Key Test:** Is the activity **essential to profit-making** or merely supportive?

### Activities That ARE Core Business (Create PE)

**❌ NOT Preparatory/Auxiliary:**

| Activity | Why It's Core Business |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Sales activities** | Directly generates revenue |
| **Contract negotiation** | Essential to securing business |
| **Customer relationship mgmt** | Core to maintaining revenue stream |
| **Technical support (post-sales)** | Essential to business model (especially SaaS/tech) |
| **Product customization** | Final value-added activity |
| **Local management** | Decision-making and coordination |

**OECD BEPS Action 7 (2017):** Tightened preparatory/auxiliary exception
- Anti-fragmentation rule: Can't split cohesive business into artificial preparatory/auxiliary activities
- Overall activity test: Look at enterprise as a whole

**Key Point:** Modern trend is **NARROW interpretation** of exception

---

## 3. AGENCY PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT (s1143 CTA 2010)

### When Does an Agent Create PE?

```
Agent creates PE if ALL conditions met:
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Agent acts on behalf of enterprise     │
│ 2. Has authority to conclude contracts    │
│ 3. Habitually exercises that authority    │
│ 4. NOT an independent agent                │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Element 1: Authority to Conclude Contracts

**Must have authority to:**
- Negotiate contract terms, AND
- Legally bind the enterprise

**Not sufficient if:**
✗ Only solicits orders subject to approval elsewhere
✗ Requires head office ratification
✗ Acts as mere introducer/referrer

**Critical Distinction:**
- **Creates PE:** UK agent negotiates and concludes sale binding on company ✓
- **No PE:** UK agent refers customer; contract concluded by foreign head office ✗

### Element 2: Habitually Exercises Authority

**"Habitually" means:**
- Regular and repeated exercise
- Part of ordinary course of business
- Not occasional or isolated instances

**Frequency Guidance:**
- Several times per year may suffice
- Must show pattern, not one-off transactions

### Element 3: Independent Agent Exception

**NO PE if agent is independent** and acting in ordinary course of their business.

**Factors Indicating Independence:**

| Factor | Independent ✓ | Dependent ✗ |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Legal** | Separate legal entity | Employee or controlled entity |
| **Economic** | Multiple principals, not economically dependent | Single principal, economically reliant |
| **Control** | No detailed instructions from principal | Subject to comprehensive control |
| **Risk** | Bears own business risk | Protected from risk by principal |
| **Exclusivity** | Non-exclusive relationship | Exclusive or near-exclusive |

**Typical Independent Agents (Usually Safe):**
✓ Brokers
✓ General commission agents
✓ Professional advisers (lawyers, accountants)
✓ Multi-principal sales agents

**Typical Dependent Agents (Create PE):**
✗ Employees
✗ Wholly-owned subsidiaries acting exclusively for parent
✗ Closely-controlled entities (even if legally separate)

**BEPS Action 7 Update:** Scrutiny increased for "commissionnaire arrangements"
- Anti-avoidance: If agent's activities designed to avoid PE, may still create one

---

## DOUBLE TAX TREATY - ARTICLE 5 OECD MODEL

### Treaty Override

**s6 CTA 2010:** Where a DTT applies, treaty definition of PE **prevails** over domestic law.

Most UK treaties follow **OECD Model Article 5**.

---

### Article 5(1): Basic Definition

"Permanent establishment" = **fixed place of business** through which business is **wholly or partly carried on**

---

### Article 5(2): Specific Inclusions

PE specifically includes:
- Place of management
- Branch
- Office
- Factory
- Workshop
- Mine, oil or gas well, quarry, or any other place of extraction of natural resources

---

### Article 5(3): Construction Sites

**Building site or construction/installation/assembly project:**

**OECD Model:** PE if duration exceeds **12 months**

**Variation:** Some treaties use 6 months or 18 months - **check specific treaty**

**Counting Time:**
- Start: When physical construction begins (not planning/design)
- End: When work substantially complete
- Interruptions: Generally do NOT restart clock

**Key Point:** Time threshold varies by treaty - always check specific DTT

---

### Article 5(4): Preparatory/Auxiliary Exclusions

Similar to domestic law but often more detailed:

Activities that do NOT create PE:
a) Facilities for storage, display, delivery
b) Stock maintenance for storage/display/delivery
c) Stock maintenance for processing by another
d) Fixed place for purchasing or information gathering
e) Fixed place for advertising, information supply, scientific research
f) Fixed place for any preparatory/auxiliary activity
g) Any combination of above (if overall character remains preparatory/auxiliary)

**BEPS Changes (Post-2017 OECD Model):**
- **Anti-fragmentation rule:** Prevents splitting cohesive business into multiple "preparatory/auxiliary" parts
- Each activity must be preparatory/auxiliary in relation to **enterprise as a whole**

---

### Article 5(5): Dependent Agent PE

**Treaty version (similar to domestic law but often worded differently):**

PE where person acts on behalf of enterprise and:
- Has and habitually exercises authority to conclude contracts in enterprise's name, OR
- [Some treaties] Has no such authority but habitually maintains stock and delivers from it

**2017 OECD Update - Broader Test:**
Authority to conclude contracts **OR** habitually plays principal role leading to conclusion of contracts **routinely concluded without material modification**

**Effect:** Catches "commissionnaire structures" where agent negotiates but doesn't formally conclude

---

### Article 5(6): Independent Agent Exception

Same principle as domestic law:
- Broker, general commission agent, or independent agent
- Acting in **ordinary course of business**
- **NOT** if devoted wholly/almost wholly to that enterprise (loses independence)

---

## SERVICE PE (Some Treaties Only)

**Not in standard OECD Model** but included in many UK treaties (e.g., UK-USA)

**Test:** Furnishing services (consulting, technical, management) in UK through employees/personnel for:
- Period(s) aggregating > **183 days** in any 12-month period

**Key Point:** Check if specific treaty includes service PE provision

---

## ATTRIBUTION OF PROFITS TO PE

### Legislation
- **s20-21 CTA 2009**: Profits attributable to UK PE
- **Article 7 OECD Model**: Business profits

### Core Principle: **Functionally Separate Entity Approach (FSEA)**

**Treat PE as if it were:**
- Separate and independent enterprise
- Dealing at arm's length with head office
- Apply transfer pricing principles

### OECD Authorised Approach (2010 Report)

**Two-Step Analysis:**

**Step 1: Functional and Factual Analysis**
- What **assets** are used by PE?
- What **functions** does PE perform?
- What **risks** does PE assume?

**Step 2: Attribution of Profits**
- Attribute profits PE would have made if independent
- Apply arm's length principle (transfer pricing)
- Recognize "dealings" between PE and head office

### Key Attribution Rules

**Income Attribution:**
- Revenue from customers attributable to PE's functions
- Notional service fees for services "provided" by head office (at arm's length)

**Expense Deductions:**
- Direct costs of PE operations ✓
- Allocated share of head office costs (reasonable basis) ✓
- Notional interest on capital attributed to PE ✓ (but see below)

**NO Deduction For:**
✗ Royalties paid to head office (no internal payments within same legal entity)
✗ Interest on actual loans from head office (unless economically separate)
✗ Management fees unless reflect genuine services at arm's length

**Capital Attribution:**
- PE must have sufficient "free capital" to support functions and risks
- Typically based on capital allocation rules
- Notional thin capitalization rules may apply

### Practical Computation

```
Revenue attributable to PE                     £X
Less: Direct costs                            (£X)
Less: Allocated head office costs             (£X)
Less: Notional interest on funding            (£X)
                                              ----
Taxable profit of PE                           £X
                                              ====

UK Corporation Tax @ 25% (or 19%)              £X
```

---

## TAX CONSEQUENCES - SUMMARY TABLE

| Scenario | UK CT Position | Compliance |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| **PE exists** | Taxable on profits attributable to PE | CT registration, CT600 filing, UK accounts |
| **No PE** | Taxable on specific UK-source income only (property, interest) | Limited/no filing (unless withholding tax) |
| **Treaty relief** | Foreign tax credit in home country for UK tax paid | Treaty claim procedures |

---

## CRITICAL THRESHOLDS & NUMBERS

| Threshold | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **6 months** | General indicator of "permanence" for fixed place (no hard rule) |
| **12 months** | Standard OECD Model threshold for construction PE (varies by treaty) |
| **183 days** | Service PE threshold (in treaties that include it) |
| **25%** | Main UK CT rate (2023 onwards) |
| **19%** | Small profits rate (profits <£50,000) |

---

## COMMON EXAM TRAPS

### ❌ Mistake → ✅ Correct Approach

1. **❌ Assuming warehouse/storage automatically creates PE**
   - ✅ Check if activities are preparatory/auxiliary - pure storage/display is excluded

2. **❌ Thinking server location creates PE**
   - ✅ HMRC guidance: server alone does NOT create PE for e-commerce (INTM267360)

3. **❌ Ignoring treaty override of domestic law**
   - ✅ Always apply treaty if one exists - treaty prevails (s6 CTA 2010)

4. **❌ Assuming sales representative automatically creates PE**
   - ✅ Only if agent has authority to conclude contracts AND habitually exercises it

5. **❌ Treating subsidiary as agent creating PE**
   - ✅ Subsidiary is separate legal entity - only creates PE if acts as dependent agent (BEPS Action 7 scrutiny)

6. **❌ Forgetting anti-fragmentation rule (BEPS)**
   - ✅ Can't artificially split cohesive business operations into multiple "preparatory/auxiliary" activities

7. **❌ Miscounting construction site duration**
   - ✅ Check specific treaty (12 months OECD standard but varies); count from physical start to substantial completion

8. **❌ Assuming any UK employee creates PE**
   - ✅ Need fixed place of business or agency relationship - mere employee presence not enough

9. **❌ Forgetting to attribute profits if PE exists**
   - ✅ Must calculate taxable profits using arm's length/FSEA principles

10. **❌ Allowing deduction for royalties to head office**
    - ✅ No deduction for internal payments within same legal entity
