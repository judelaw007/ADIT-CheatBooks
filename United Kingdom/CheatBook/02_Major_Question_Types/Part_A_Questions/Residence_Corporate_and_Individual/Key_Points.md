## INDIVIDUAL RESIDENCE - STATUTORY RESIDENCE TEST (SRT)

### Legislation
**FA 2013, Schedule 45**

### Test Structure (Hierarchical - Must Apply in Order)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. AUTOMATIC OVERSEAS TEST (AOT)   │ ← If met → Non-UK Resident
│     ↓ (if not met)                  │
│  2. AUTOMATIC UK TEST (AUT)         │ ← If met → UK Resident
│     ↓ (if not met)                  │
│  3. SUFFICIENT TIES TEST (STT)      │ ← Depends on days + ties
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### 1. AUTOMATIC OVERSEAS TEST (Conclusive Non-Residence)

**AOT 1:** Non-resident in **all** of previous 3 tax years AND present in UK < **46 days**

**AOT 2:** UK resident in **one or more** of previous 3 tax years AND present in UK < **16 days**

**AOT 3:** Leave UK to carry out **full-time work abroad** AND:
- Present in UK < **91 days**, AND
- No more than **30 days** spent working in UK (>3 hours per day)

**Key Point:** If ANY AOT is met → **Conclusively non-UK resident** (stop here)

---

### 2. AUTOMATIC UK TEST (Conclusive Residence)

**AUT 1:** Present in UK for **183 days or more**

**AUT 2:** **Only home in UK** (or UK + overseas homes but stays **only** in UK home for 30+ days)
- Home must be available for 90+ days
- Individual must spend at least 1 night in it

**AUT 3:** **Full-time work in UK**:
- Work >3 hours per day on **40+ days** in tax year
- No significant break from UK work (>30 days)

**Key Point:** If ANY AUT is met → **Conclusively UK resident** (stop here)

---

### 3. SUFFICIENT TIES TEST

**Applies only if:** Neither AOT nor AUT is met

#### UK Ties (Maximum 5 for "leavers", 4 for "arrivers")

| Tie | Condition | Notes |
|-----|-----------|-------|
| **Family** | Spouse/partner or minor children UK resident **in own right** | Must apply SRT to spouse independently |
| **Accommodation** | Available UK accommodation 91+ days AND spend at least 1 night in it | Must actually USE the accommodation |
| **Work** | Substantive UK work: >3 hours on **40+ days** | Threshold is strict |
| **90-Day** | Spent 90+ days in UK in **either** of previous 2 tax years | Look back 2 years |
| **Country** | Spent more days in UK than any other single country | **Arrivers only** (not leavers) |

#### Sufficient Ties Tables

**For "LEAVERS" (UK resident in one or more of previous 3 tax years):**

| UK Days in Year | 4 Ties | 3 Ties | 2 Ties | 1 Tie | 0 Ties |
|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| < 16            | NR     | NR     | NR     | NR    | NR     |
| 16-45           | **R**  | **R**  | **R**  | **R** | NR     |
| 46-90           | **R**  | **R**  | **R**  | NR    | NR     |
| 91-120          | **R**  | **R**  | **R**  | NR    | NR     |
| 121-182         | **R**  | **R**  | NR     | NR    | NR     |
| 183+            | **R**  | **R**  | **R**  | **R** | **R**  |

**For "ARRIVERS" (non-resident in all of previous 3 tax years):**

| UK Days in Year | 4 Ties | 3 Ties | 2 Ties | 1 Tie | 0 Ties |
|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| < 46            | NR     | NR     | NR     | NR    | NR     |
| 46-90           | **R**  | **R**  | NR     | NR    | NR     |
| 91-120          | **R**  | **R**  | **R**  | NR    | NR     |
| 121-182         | **R**  | **R**  | **R**  | **R** | NR     |
| 183+            | **R**  | **R**  | **R**  | **R** | **R**  |

**R** = UK Resident | **NR** = Non-UK Resident

---

### Day Counting Rules

✅ **Count as UK day:**
- Present in UK at **midnight**
- Day of arrival counts
- Deliberate medical treatment in UK (even if for good reasons)

❌ **Do NOT count:**
- Day of departure
- Exceptional circumstances (only if **no choice** - e.g., forced hospitalization, natural disaster, war)
- In transit (< 24 hours, reasonable transit, no other activity)

**Critical:** Hospital stays only qualify for exception if individual had **NO CHOICE** to be in UK

---

### Split Year Treatment

Applies where individual:
- Arrives in UK to become resident, OR
- Leaves UK after being resident

**Effect:** Tax year split into:
- **UK part:** Taxable on worldwide income/gains
- **Overseas part:** Taxable on UK-source income/gains only

**Cases include:**
- Starting full-time work in UK/abroad
- Ceasing to have home in UK
- Partner of someone starting work abroad
- Returning to UK after FT work abroad

**Key Point:** Must meet strict statutory conditions - not automatic

---

### Temporary Non-Residence (TNR) Rules

**Applies if:**
1. UK resident for at least **4 of 7 tax years** before departure, AND
2. Non-UK resident for period not exceeding **5 tax years**, AND
3. Become UK resident again

**Effect - Capital Gains:**
- Gains on **assets owned pre-departure** arising during temporary non-residence
- Taxed in **year of return**
- Exception: UK land (already taxable under NRCGT)

**Effect - Income:**
- Certain income caught (e.g., **close company distributions**)
- Normal commercial dividends from public companies usually **NOT caught** (disregarded income)

**Tax Year:** Applies to gains/income arising in **period of non-residence**

---

## CORPORATE RESIDENCE

### Three Tests for UK Tax Residence

#### 1. Place of Incorporation (Statutory Test)

**s14 CTA 2009:**
- Company incorporated **in UK** = **Automatically UK resident**
- Applies from 15 March 1988 onwards
- Subject to treaty override (if dual resident)

**Key Point:** Incorporation alone is sufficient - no need to show CMC or POEM

#### 2. Central Management and Control (Common Law Test)

**Leading Cases:**
- **De Beers Consolidated Mines v Howe [1906]**
- **Untelrab v McGregor [1996]**
- **Wood v Holden [2006]**

**Test:** Where are **strategic decisions** made?

**Factors:**
- Location of **board meetings** (key factor)
- Where directors exercise **real decision-making power**
- Where key contracts negotiated/signed
- Location of day-to-day management (less relevant)

**⚠️ Warning:**
- Holding board meetings in UK = **HIGH RISK** of UK CMC
- Formal ratification elsewhere may be disregarded if decisions effectively made in UK
- Can create dual residence → no treaty protection

**Key Point:** CMC is where **real power** lies, not just formal approvals

#### 3. Place of Effective Management (POEM) - Treaty Tie-Breaker

**Article 4(3) OECD Model (pre-2017):**
If company is resident of both Contracting States, deemed resident where POEM is situated.

**Article 4(3) OECD Model (2017 onwards):**
Matter to be settled by **mutual agreement** between competent authorities.

**POEM Definition (OECD Commentary):**
Place where key management and commercial decisions necessary for conduct of entity's business as a whole are in substance made.

**Key Point:** If dual resident under both domestic laws, company may lose treaty protection

---

### UK Permanent Establishment (PE)

**Legislation:** s1141-1143 CTA 2010; Article 5 OECD Model

#### Fixed Place PE (s1141)

**Requirements:**
1. **Fixed place of business** in UK, AND
2. Business of company **carried on through** that fixed place

**Examples of fixed place:**
- Office ✓
- Branch ✓
- Factory ✓
- Workshop ✓
- Mine, oil/gas well ✓
- **Server/website: Generally NO ✗**

**Duration:** Must have degree of permanence (no strict time limit, but >6 months often indicative)

**Ownership:** Rental premises count ✓

#### Preparatory or Auxiliary Exception (s1143)

**PE does NOT exist if** activities are of preparatory or auxiliary character.

**Examples of preparatory/auxiliary:**
- Storage, display, delivery of goods
- Maintenance of stock for processing by another
- Purchasing goods/collecting information
- Advertising, providing information, market research

**⚠️ Warning:** "Core" business activities are **NOT** preparatory/auxiliary:
- Marketing services to customers
- Technical support
- Customer relationship management
- Sales functions (even if not concluding contracts)

#### Agency PE (s1143)

A person acting in UK on behalf of company creates PE if:
1. Has and habitually exercises authority to **conclude contracts** on behalf of company, OR
2. Habitually maintains stock and regularly delivers on behalf of company

**Independent Agent Exception:**
No PE if agent is independent and acting in ordinary course of business.

---

### Double Tax Treaty - Residence Tie-Breaker (Article 4(2) OECD Model)

**For Individuals (Cascade):**

1. **Permanent home** → Resident where permanent home available
2. If homes in both States → **Centre of vital interests** (personal & economic relations)
3. If centre unclear → **Habitual abode**
4. If habitual abode in both/neither → **Nationality**
5. If national of both/neither → **Mutual agreement** by competent authorities

**Centre of Vital Interests Factors:**
- Family location (spouse, children)
- Social ties (friends, clubs, cultural activities)
- Economic ties (business interests, property, investments)
- Political ties (voting, civic engagement)
- Cultural ties (language, library, affiliations)

**Key Point:** Subjective test - requires balancing multiple factors

---

## TAX CONSEQUENCES OF RESIDENCE STATUS

### Individuals

| Status | Income Tax | Capital Gains Tax |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **UK Resident** | Worldwide income taxable | Worldwide gains taxable |
| **UK Resident (Non-Dom on RB)** | UK-source + remitted foreign income | UK assets + remitted foreign gains |
| **Non-UK Resident** | UK-source income only | UK land + certain other UK assets only |

**Relief:** Foreign tax credit under DTA or unilateral relief (TIOPA 2010, Part 2)

### Companies

| Status | Corporation Tax Scope |
|--------|----------------------|
| **UK Resident** | Worldwide profits (s5 CTA 2009) |
| **Non-UK Resident with UK PE** | Profits attributable to PE only (s19 CTA 2009) |
| **Non-UK Resident (no PE)** | UK property income + certain other UK-source income only |

**PE Attribution:** Follow OECD Authorised Approach (Article 7) - effectively transfer pricing principles

## COMMON EXAM TRAPS

### ❌ Mistake → ✅ Correct Approach

1. **❌ Assuming hospital stays always qualify for exceptional circumstances**
   - ✅ Only if NO CHOICE - deliberate return counts as UK days

2. **❌ Forgetting to apply SRT to spouse to determine family tie**
   - ✅ Must establish spouse's residence independently

3. **❌ Counting accommodation tie when individual doesn't use the property**
   - ✅ Must spend at least 1 night - "available" alone is not enough

4. **❌ Using wrong table (arrivers vs leavers) in sufficient ties test**
   - ✅ Check if resident in previous 3 years → leaver

5. **❌ Stopping at "permanent home" in DTA tie-breaker**
   - ✅ If homes in both countries, continue down cascade

6. **❌ Assuming CMC is where formal ratification occurs**
   - ✅ CMC is where REAL strategic decisions are made

7. **❌ Thinking server/website creates PE**
   - ✅ HMRC guidance: server alone does NOT create PE for e-commerce

8. **❌ Assuming all income caught by TNR rules**
   - ✅ Close company distributions caught; public company dividends usually not

9. **❌ Forgetting treaty override for incorporated companies**
   - ✅ UK incorporation → UK resident, BUT treaty may override if dual resident

10. **❌ Ignoring dual residence risk when holding board meetings in UK**
    - ✅ Dual residence → no treaty protection → double taxation
