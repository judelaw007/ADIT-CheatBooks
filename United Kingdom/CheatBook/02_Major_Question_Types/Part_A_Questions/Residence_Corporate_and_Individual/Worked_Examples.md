## Example 1: Individual Residence - SRT with DTA Tie-Breaker (June 2025)

### Question (25 marks - 45 minutes)

**PART 1 (15 marks)**

Daniel Door, a UK citizen and UK domiciled individual, left the UK on 1 April 2023 with his wife Frederica to live in Spain where he became tax resident. In 2023/24, Daniel received a £40 million dividend from AI-5 (a public listed company) where he was a non-executive director. After receiving the dividend, he immediately resigned and sold his shares, generating a capital gain of £160 million.

The couple have two adult children and three grandchildren, all UK resident, who often visit their Spanish home.

On 1 February 2025, Daniel suffered a serious skiing injury in Switzerland and, for family reasons, decided to immediately fly back to the UK under medical supervision.

**Day count as of 1 February 2025 (2024/25):**
- Spain: 95 days (in Spanish home)
- UK: 70 days (entirely in hotels, visiting friends/family)
- Italy: 40 days
- Other countries: 97 days
- **Total: 302 days (6 April 2024 - 31 January 2025)**

Daniel was given strict medical advice to remain in hospital until end of February 2025. The couple have homes in several countries including Spain and UK. Daniel maintains an extensive English literature library in both Spanish and UK homes. However, Daniel has not stayed at the UK home since 1 April 2023, despite it remaining fully furnished and available.

Daniel only worked in the UK for more than 3 hours on 5 occasions during 2024/25, and did no work in Spain. He spent 92 days in the UK in 2022/23 and 30 days in 2023/24. Frederica accompanied Daniel on all visits. In 2024/25, Frederica worked in the UK for more than 3 hours on 45 days.

**Assumptions:**
- Daniel spent 1-28 February 2025 in UK hospital (28 days)
- Daniel spent 1 March - 5 April 2025 in Spain (35 days)
- Frederica's travel pattern mirrors Daniel's
- Daniel and Frederica were UK non-resident in 2023/24

**Required:**
1. Discuss Daniel's expected UK tax residence position under the SRT for 2024/25 (assume Frederica's travel pattern mirrors Daniel's). **(15 marks)**
2. Assuming Daniel is UK resident under the SRT, explain his position under the residence article of the Spain-UK DTA (assume Daniel is Spanish tax resident in 2024/25 and DTA follows OECD Model). **(5 marks)**
3. Assuming Daniel is UK resident under the SRT for 2024/25, explain how Daniel's income and gains arising in 2023/24 will be taxed in the UK (ignore Spain-UK DTA implications). **(5 marks)**

---

### Model Answer

#### **PART 1: SRT Analysis (15 marks)**

**Step 1: Establish the Final Day Count**

Based on the assumptions provided:
- Spain: 95 + 35 (Mar-Apr) = **130 days**
- UK: 70 + 28 (hospital Feb) = **98 days**
- Italy: **40 days**
- Other countries: **97 days**
- **Total: 365 days**

**Critical Issue:** Daniel made a deliberate choice for family reasons to be treated in the UK. Hospital stays qualify for the exceptional circumstances exception **only** if the individual had no choice. Here, Daniel chose to return to the UK, so the 28 hospital days **count as UK days**.

**Step 2: Apply the Statutory Residence Test (SRT)**

The SRT consists of three hierarchical tests (FA 2013, Sch 45):
1. Automatic Overseas Test (AOT)
2. Automatic UK Test (AUT)
3. Sufficient Ties Test (STT)

**A. Automatic Overseas Test (Conclusive Non-Residence)**

**AOT 1:** Non-resident in all of previous 3 tax years AND present in UK for fewer than 46 days
- ❌ **Not met:** Daniel was resident in 2022/23

**AOT 2:** UK resident in one or more of previous 3 tax years AND present in UK for fewer than 16 days
- ❌ **Not met:** Daniel spent 98 days in UK (exceeds 16-day threshold)

**AOT 3:** Leave UK to carry out full-time work abroad, present in UK for fewer than 91 days, and no more than 30 days spent working in UK
- ❌ **Not met:** Daniel does no work for more than half the year and cannot satisfy "full-time work abroad" test

**Conclusion:** Daniel does not meet any Automatic Overseas Test → proceed to Automatic UK Test

**B. Automatic UK Test (Conclusive Residence)**

**AUT 1:** Present for 183 days or more in the tax year
- ❌ **Not met:** Daniel spent only 98 days in UK

**AUT 2:** Only home in UK (or UK + overseas homes but stays only in UK home for 30+ days and home available for 90+ days)
- ❌ **Not met:** Daniel has homes in several countries and spent **zero days** in his UK home during 2024/25

**AUT 3:** Carry out full-time work in UK (40+ days, more than 3 hours per day)
- ❌ **Not met:** Daniel only worked in UK for more than 3 hours on 5 occasions

**Conclusion:** Daniel does not meet any Automatic UK Test → proceed to Sufficient Ties Test

**C. Sufficient Ties Test**

Daniel is a **"leaver"** (UK resident in one or more of previous 3 tax years).

**Tie 1: Family Tie**

Condition: Spouse/civil partner or minor children are UK resident in their own right (not contingent on individual's residence).

**Analysis:**
- Daniel has no minor children ✓
- Frederica is UK resident because she:
  - Has 2 ties: (i) work tie (worked more than 3 hours on 45 days), (ii) 90-day tie (spent 92 days in UK in 2022/23)
  - Spent 98 days in UK in 2024/25
  - With 2 ties and 91-120 days → **UK resident**

**Conclusion:** Daniel **has a family tie** ✓

**Tie 2: Accommodation Tie**

Condition: Available accommodation in UK for continuous period of 91+ days AND individual spends at least 1 night in it during the tax year.

**Analysis:**
- Daniel has a UK home available for the entire year ✓
- Daniel spent **zero nights** in the UK home (all time in hotels) ✗

**Conclusion:** Daniel **does not have an accommodation tie**

**Tie 3: Work Tie (Substantive UK Work)**

Condition: Work more than 3 hours in the UK on 40+ days in the tax year.

**Analysis:**
- Daniel only worked more than 3 hours in UK on **5 occasions**
- Falls far short of 40-day threshold

**Conclusion:** Daniel **does not have a work tie**

**Tie 4: 90-Day Tie**

Condition: Spent more than 90 days in UK in either of the previous 2 tax years.

**Analysis:**
- 2022/23: **92 days** (exceeds 90) ✓
- 2023/24: 30 days

**Conclusion:** Daniel **has a 90-day tie** ✓

**Tie 5: Country Tie (only for arrivers)**

Not applicable to Daniel as he is a "leaver", not an "arriv er".

**Summary of Ties:**
- Family tie: ✓
- Accommodation tie: ✗
- Work tie: ✗
- 90-day tie: ✓
- **Total: 2 ties**

**Apply Sufficient Ties Table (Leavers)**

| UK Days | 4 Ties | 3 Ties | 2 Ties | 1 Tie |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| 16-45   | R      | R      | R      | R     |
| 46-90   | R      | R      | R      | NR    |
| 91-120  | R      | R      | **R**  | NR    |
| 121-182 | R      | **R**  | NR     | NR    |

**Daniel:** 98 days in UK + 2 ties = **UK RESIDENT** ✓

**Conclusion:** Daniel is UK tax resident for 2024/25 under the Statutory Residence Test.

---

#### **PART 2: DTA Residence Tie-Breaker (5 marks)**

Since Daniel is UK resident under the SRT and Spanish tax resident under Spanish domestic law, he is **dual resident**. The Spain-UK DTA (following OECD Model Article 4(2)) provides a tie-breaker test:

**Article 4(2) OECD Model - Tie-Breaker Cascade:**

**Test 1: Permanent Home Available**

A person is resident where they have a permanent home. If permanent homes in both States, proceed to Test 2.

**Analysis:**
- Daniel has homes in both Spain and UK ✓
- Both homes have character of permanence (both house extensive libraries) ✓
- The fact Daniel did not visit UK home in 2024/25 is not a treaty requirement

**Conclusion:** Permanent homes in both countries → proceed to Test 2

**Test 2: Centre of Vital Interests (Personal and Economic Relations)**

A person is resident in the State to which their personal and economic relations are closer.

**Analysis:**

*Personal Relations:*
- **UK factors:** Adult children and grandchildren all UK resident; visits friends and family in UK; extensive English literature library; British citizenship; long-term UK ties
- **Spanish factors:** Spouse Frederica is arguably more Spanish resident (spends significant time there); Spanish home is primary residence; established life in Spain

*Economic Relations:*
- **UK factors:** Former director of UK public company; £40m dividend and £160m gain from UK company (though realized in 2023/24)
- **Spanish factors:** Limited information provided

**Assessment:**
While the facts are not conclusive, the weight of **personal connections appears to favor the UK**: family (children/grandchildren), cultural ties (English literature), friendships, and patterns of social interaction. Frederica's position is ambiguous as she also spends significant time in UK.

**Conclusion:** Arguable that centre of vital interests is in the **UK** (though not definitive)

**Test 3: Habitual Abode**

If centre of vital interests cannot be determined, residence is where the person has their habitual abode.

**Analysis:**
- Daniel has homes in both countries and spends significant time in both
- Pattern of life involves both Spain and UK

**Conclusion:** Daniel has a habitual abode in **both countries** → proceed to Test 4

**Test 4: Nationality**

If habitual abode in both States or neither, person is resident of the State of which they are a national.

**Analysis:**
- Daniel is a **British citizen** (UK national)
- No mention of Spanish citizenship

**Conclusion:** Under Article 4(2), treaty residence awarded to **UK** ✓

**Summary:**
While insufficient information prevents conclusive determination of centre of vital interests, the evidence suggests significant risk that treaty residence would be awarded to the UK, particularly given:
- Personal connections weighted toward UK
- Habitual abode in both countries
- Sole British citizenship acts as tie-breaker

**Practical Consequence:** If treaty residence is awarded to UK, Daniel is taxable in UK on worldwide income and gains, with Spain required to provide relief for double taxation under Article 23 (Methods for Elimination of Double Taxation).

#### **PART 3: Temporary Non-Residence Rules (5 marks)**

**Overview of TNR Rules (TCGA 1992, s 10A & ITTOIA 2005, s 832)**

The Temporary Non-Residence (TNR) rules apply to individuals who:
1. Were UK resident for at least **4 of the 7 tax years** immediately before departure
2. Become non-UK resident for a period not exceeding **5 tax years**
3. Subsequently return to UK residence

**Purpose:** To prevent individuals from avoiding UK tax by temporarily leaving the UK to realize gains or certain income.

**Daniel's Position:**
- Always UK resident before departure on 1 April 2023 ✓ (clearly meets 4 of 7 year test)
- Non-UK resident in 2023/24 only (1 year)
- UK resident again in 2024/25 ✓
- Period of non-residence: **less than 5 years** ✓

**Conclusion:** TNR rules **apply** to Daniel ✓

**Application to 2023/24 Income and Gains**

**A. Capital Gains (£160 million gain on AI-5 shares)**

**General Rule (TCGA 1992, s 10A):**
Any capital gains arising during the period of temporary non-residence on assets owned before departure are treated as arising in the **year of return** (2024/25) and taxed accordingly.

**Exception:**
Disposals of interests in UK land are subject to NRCGT (Non-Resident Capital Gains Tax) during non-residence anyway, so TNR does not apply to those gains.

**Application:**
- AI-5 shares were owned before departure ✓
- Gain arose during period of non-residence (2023/24) ✓
- AI-5 is a public listed company (not UK land) ✓

**Tax Treatment:**
The **£160 million gain** is treated as arising in **2024/25** (year of return) and subject to UK CGT at applicable rates:
- Basic rate band remaining: 10% CGT
- Higher/additional rate: 20% CGT
- Annual exempt amount (2024/25): £3,000

**Estimated Tax:**
Assuming Daniel has other income using basic rate band:
- (£160,000,000 - £3,000) × 20% = **£31,999,400 CGT**

**B. Dividend Income (£40 million from AI-5)**

**General Rule:**
TNR rules also apply to various types of income, including distributions from **close companies**.

**Application:**
- AI-5 is described as a **public listed company**
- Public listed companies are typically **not close companies**
- Therefore, the £40 million dividend should **not** be subject to TNR rules

**Disregarded Income Relief (ITA 2007, s 811):**
Even if the dividend were potentially within TNR, it would likely qualify for "disregarded income" relief as it represents normal commercial dividend from a widely-held company where Daniel was a non-executive director.

**Tax Treatment:**
The £40 million dividend, while subject to UK tax in the year it arose (2023/24), is **not brought back into charge in 2024/25** under TNR rules.

**However:** If Daniel was UK resident in 2023/24 under a different analysis, the dividend would have been taxable in that year anyway:
- Dividend allowance: £1,000 (2023/24) or £500 (2024/25)
- Dividend ordinary rate: 8.75%
- Dividend upper rate: 33.75%
- Dividend additional rate: 39.35%

**Summary:**
1. **£160 million capital gain:** Taxable in 2024/25 under TNR rules (approximately £32 million CGT)
2. **£40 million dividend:** Not subject to TNR rules (public company, disregarded income)

**Recommendations:**
- Daniel should review whether any other income or gains arose during 2023/24
- Consider whether split-year treatment might apply for 2023/24 departure
- Evaluate whether any reliefs or elections are available
- Ensure Spain-UK DTA is properly applied for double taxation relief

## Example 2: Corporate Residence & PE Risk (June 2025)

### Question (25 marks - 45 minutes)

Solaris Future SA is a solar panel manufacturing company, incorporated and tax resident in Spain. Solar panels are manufactured in Spain, using IP also held in Spain. The company currently has minimal UK presence - an English language website on a UK server through which it sells a small number of solar panels to UK customers.

Solaris Future SA plans to expand UK operations and is considering two options:

**Option 1: UK Branch**
- Open a branch to provide marketing services and technical support to UK customers
- UK branch will NOT negotiate or conclude sales contracts
- Solar panels continue to be installed by independent third-party contractors
- UK employees based in rented office premises in London (short-term lease, unconnected landlord)
- Some board meetings held in UK office, but all major strategic decisions formally signed off in Spanish head office

**Option 2: UK Subsidiary (Solaris UK Ltd)**
- Incorporate UK company, wholly owned by Solaris Future SA
- Provide technical and sales support to UK customers
- Employ team of technicians for solar panel installation
- Acquire UK office premises
- Board includes UK and Spanish-resident directors
- All board meetings in London
- Solaris Future SA provides £100m loan at 4.5% interest to cover:
  - Office premises: £40m
  - Plant and machinery for installations: £25m
  - Working capital: £5m
  - Acquisition of 5% stake in Solaris Research SA (Spanish loss-making R&D company, 100% subsidiary of Solaris Future SA): £30m

The £30m investment in Solaris Research SA would support the commercial objectives of the Solaris group, as Solaris Research SA provides important R&D services to Solaris Future SA.

Once Solaris UK Ltd is incorporated, its board will formally approve the loan from Solaris Future SA.

**Assumptions:**
- Loan unaffected by Corporate Interest Restriction regime
- Loan amount and terms (including 4.5% interest rate) are at arm's length
- Neither loan instrument nor entities have hybrid features
- UK-Spain DTA follows OECD Model Tax Convention 2017

**Required:**
1. Advise on UK corporate tax implications of current structure and the two expansion options. **(13 marks)**
2. Overview of unallowable purpose rule and possible impact on proposed loan under Option 2. **(8 marks)**
3. Withholding and UK corporate tax implications of dividend payments received and paid by Solaris UK Ltd under Option 2. **(4 marks)**

---

### Model Answer

#### **PART 1: UK Corporate Tax Implications (13 marks)**

**A. Current Structure**

**UK PE Analysis (s1141 CTA 2010):**

A non-UK resident company has a UK Permanent Establishment if:
1. It has a **fixed place of business** in UK through which business is wholly or partly carried on; OR
2. An agent acting on behalf of the company has and habitually exercises authority to do business in the UK (**dependent agent PE**)

**Application to Current Structure:**

*Server and Website:*
- A server hosting a website does **not** constitute a PE
- HMRC guidance: A server, either alone or with websites, cannot constitute a PE for a business conducting e-commerce
- The website is merely a means of displaying information and facilitating orders

**Conclusion:** Under current structure, Solaris Future SA is **unlikely** to have a UK PE and therefore **no UK Corporation Tax exposure** on UK sales.

**B. Option 1: UK Branch**

**Fixed Place PE Analysis:**

**Does Solaris Future SA have a fixed place of business in the UK?**

*s1141 CTA 2010 specifically references an office as a fixed place of business.*

✓ **Yes:**
- Rented office premises in London = fixed place of business
- The fact that premises are rented (not owned) is **irrelevant**
- Short-term lease is also **irrelevant** - any degree of permanence suffices
- Business activities (marketing services, technical support) are carried on through this office

**Preparatory or Auxiliary Exception (s1143 CTA 2010):**

A company will NOT be regarded as having a PE if the activities at the fixed place are of a **preparatory or auxiliary character**.

s1143 lists specific activities deemed preparatory/auxiliary, including:
- Storage, display, or delivery of goods
- Purchasing goods or collecting information
- Other activities of preparatory or auxiliary character

**Application:**
- Marketing services and technical support to customers are **core business activities**
- These are NOT merely preparatory or auxiliary to Solaris Future SA's business
- They directly support and facilitate customer acquisition and retention

**Conclusion:** s1143 exception does **NOT apply** ✗

**Result:** Option 1 creates a **UK Permanent Establishment** ✓

**UK Tax Consequences:**
- Solaris Future SA must register for UK Corporation Tax
- Submit annual CT return
- Profits attributable to the PE subject to UK CT
- Attribution follows **Authorised OECD Approach** (Article 7 OECD Model) - effectively transfer pricing principles
- Functional analysis required to determine profits attributable to UK PE

**Additional Risk: UK Tax Residence (Central Management and Control)**

**Critical Issue:** Holding board meetings in the UK creates **significant risk** that HMRC may argue the company is **centrally managed and controlled in the UK**, making it UK tax resident even though incorporated in Spain.

**Central Management and Control Test:**
- Where are **strategic decisions** made?
- Board meetings in UK + decisions made there = strong evidence of UK CMC
- Formal sign-off in Spain may be disregarded if decisions effectively made in UK

**Dual Residence Risk:**
If both UK and Spain consider Solaris Future SA tax resident:
- Company is **"dual-resident"** under both domestic laws
- Dual-resident companies are **NOT entitled to treaty protection** under Article 4(3) OECD Model
- Results in **unrelieved double taxation**

**Strong Recommendation:**
- **Do NOT hold board meetings in UK**
- Ensure all strategic decisions are **actually made in Spain**
- Only operational/administrative meetings in UK (if any)

**C. Option 2: UK Subsidiary (Solaris UK Ltd)**

**UK Tax Residence:**

Solaris UK Ltd will be UK tax resident on three grounds:
1. **Incorporation test:** Incorporated in UK → UK resident (s14 CTA 2009)
2. **Central management and control:** Board meetings in London → CMC in UK
3. **Place of effective management (POEM):** Board includes UK/Spanish directors, but all meetings in London → POEM in UK

**UK Tax Consequences:**

As a UK resident company, Solaris UK Ltd is chargeable to **UK CT on worldwide profits** (s5 CTA 2009).

**Transfer Pricing Considerations:**

Solaris UK Ltd will presumably acquire solar panels from Solaris Future SA. All transactions between the two companies will be within scope of **UK transfer pricing rules** (TIOPA 2010, Part 4), assuming SME exemptions don't apply.

**SME Exemption Analysis:**
- UK company must meet SME thresholds: <250 employees, ≤€50m turnover OR ≤€43m balance sheet
- Thresholds apply at **group level** (not standalone)
- Solaris Future SA is Spanish group parent - need to assess group-wide figures
- If group exceeds thresholds → transfer pricing rules apply in full

**Result:** Solaris UK Ltd must compute **arm's length price** for all intra-group transactions.

**Substance and Commercial Rationale:**
- Option 2 provides **genuine UK substance**: own premises, employees, installation capability
- Lower PE risk for Solaris Future SA compared to Option 1
- Clearer separation of functions between parent and subsidiary

**Summary Comparison:**

| Aspect | Current | Option 1 | Option 2 |
|--------|---------|----------|----------|
| UK PE | No | Yes | N/A (UK company) |
| UK CT exposure | No | Yes (PE profits) | Yes (worldwide) |
| Dual residence risk | No | **HIGH** | No |
| Transfer pricing | N/A | Yes (if applicable) | Yes (if above SME) |
| Substance in UK | Minimal | Moderate | **Strong** |
| Recommendation | - | **High risk** | **Preferred** |

**Conclusion:** Option 2 is **preferable** from a tax and commercial perspective, provided the unallowable purpose issue (see Part 2) is addressed.

---

#### **PART 2: Unallowable Purpose Rule (8 marks)**

**Overview of Unallowable Purpose Rule (s441-442 CTA 2009)**

The unallowable purpose rule is a **targeted anti-avoidance rule** (TAAR) that restricts tax deductions for loan relationship debits (interest expense) where a loan has an **unallowable purpose**.

**Key Definitions:**

**Unallowable Purpose (s441):**
A purpose is "unallowable" if it is **not amongst the business or other commercial purposes** of the company.

**Tax Advantage Purpose (s442):**
Where one of the **main purposes** of a company in entering into the loan relationship is to secure a **tax advantage** for itself or any other person, such a purpose is treated as **not being a business or other commercial purpose**.

**Consequence:**
No deduction is available for any part of the interest expense attributable to the unallowable purpose.

**Application to £100m Loan:**

**A. Operational Expenses (£70m)**

**Purpose:**
- Office premises (£40m): Directly supports UK operations ✓
- Plant & machinery (£25m): Essential for installation services ✓
- Working capital (£5m): Necessary for day-to-day operations ✓

**Commercial Justification:**
These expenditures clearly serve the **business and commercial purposes** of Solaris UK Ltd - they enable it to carry out its trade in the UK.

**Conclusion:** Interest on **£70m unlikely** to be within scope of unallowable purpose rule ✓

**B. Investment in Solaris Research SA (£30m)**

**Issue:**
It is **unclear** how the £30m investment in Solaris Research SA serves the **business or commercial purposes of Solaris UK Ltd specifically**.

**Risk Factors:**
1. **Asset location:** Investment is in a **non-UK asset** (Spanish company)
2. **Indirect benefit:** Solaris Research SA provides R&D services to **Solaris Future SA** (parent), not directly to Solaris UK Ltd
3. **Non-commercial return:** Solaris Research SA is **loss-making** - no dividend income expected
4. **Tax deduction creation:** The structure creates **UK tax deductions** (£30m × 4.5% = £1.35m annual interest) for an investment that doesn't directly benefit the UK company
5. **Main purpose test:** Arguable that a main purpose is to create **tax advantage** (UK interest deductions) rather than genuine commercial benefit to Solaris UK Ltd

**Potential HMRC Arguments:**
- The £30m is used to acquire a non-UK asset with **no direct link** to UK operations
- Solaris UK Ltd unlikely to receive any return on investment (company is loss-making)
- True beneficiary is **Solaris Future SA** (parent), not Solaris UK Ltd
- Main purpose may be to secure UK tax deductions via interest on loan that doesn't serve UK business needs

**Counter-Arguments (Defensive Position):**
- Investment may have **strategic value** to Solaris UK Ltd:
  - Access to group R&D for UK-specific product customization
  - Technology transfer for UK market innovations
  - Potential future collaboration on UK customer needs
- **Group synergy:** Supporting group R&D infrastructure benefits all group companies
- Board approval demonstrates **commercial consideration**

**Recent Case Law Guidance:**

Post-**Blackrock** and **Development Securities** cases:
- Board consideration and approval is **not sufficient** by itself
- HMRC scrutinizes **actual commercial rationale** for the borrowing entity
- Formal documentation helps but does not guarantee protection
- Must demonstrate **genuine expected benefit** to the borrowing company (not just group)

**Quantification of Risk:**

If £30m investment is caught by unallowable purpose rule:
- Disallowed annual interest: £30m × 4.5% = **£1,350,000**
- Lost tax deduction @ 25% CT rate = **£337,500 annual tax cost**

**Recommendations to Mitigate Risk:**

1. **Document Commercial Rationale:**
   - Prepare detailed memorandum explaining how Solaris UK Ltd expects to benefit from the investment
   - Quantify expected benefits (e.g., cost savings on R&D, faster product development for UK market)
   - Show direct link to UK business strategy

2. **Board Process:**
   - Board of Solaris UK Ltd must **actively consider** this portion of the loan
   - Minutes should record detailed discussion of commercial benefits to UK company
   - Independent directors (if any) should participate in decision
   - Consider obtaining third-party valuation/opinion on commercial benefits

3. **Restructure If Possible:**
   - Consider whether Solaris UK Ltd needs to hold equity in Solaris Research SA
   - Alternatively, could Solaris UK Ltd pay arm's length fees directly to Solaris Research SA for services?
   - Could Solaris Future SA fund the £30m investment itself, reducing Solaris UK Ltd loan to £70m?

4. **Transfer Pricing Documentation:**
   - Ensure £30m investment and 5% shareholding have commercial substance
   - Document expected returns and strategic benefits
   - Align with OECD BEPS Action 8-10 guidance

**Conclusion:**

**Moderate to High Risk** that HMRC would challenge interest deductibility on the £30m portion of the loan under the unallowable purpose rule. Solaris Future SA should:
- Carefully document the commercial rationale
- Ensure genuine UK business benefit can be demonstrated
- Consider restructuring to reduce risk
- Seek advance clearance if uncertainty remains

---

#### **PART 3: Withholding Tax and Dividend Exemptions (4 marks)**

**A. Dividend Payments PAID by Solaris UK Ltd (to Solaris Future SA)**

**UK Domestic Law:**
- There are **NO provisions** within UK domestic law requiring withholding tax on dividend payments
- Unlike interest and royalties, **dividends are not subject to UK withholding tax**

**Result:** Solaris UK Ltd can pay dividends to Solaris Future SA **without** deducting any UK withholding tax ✓

**B. Dividend Payments RECEIVED by Solaris UK Ltd (from Solaris Research SA)**

**Issue:**
Solaris UK Ltd proposes to acquire 5% of Solaris Research SA (Spanish company). Any dividends received from Solaris Research SA may be subject to:
1. **Spanish withholding tax** (source country taxation)
2. **UK Corporation Tax** (residence country taxation)

**Spanish Withholding Tax:**

The withholding tax position on dividends received from Spain will depend on **Spanish domestic law** and the **Spain-UK DTA**.

Typical position:
- Spanish domestic law: May impose withholding tax on dividends (rates vary - commonly 19%)
- Spain-UK DTA: Typically reduces withholding tax rate (e.g., to 0%, 5%, or 15% depending on ownership percentage and DTA article)

**UK Corporation Tax on Dividends Received:**

**General Rule (Part 9A CTA 2009):**
Most foreign and UK dividends received by UK companies are **exempt from Corporation Tax**.

**Relevant Exemption:**
s931G CTA 2009 - **Dividends from non-small companies** are exempt where:
- Payer is not a "small company" (as defined), OR
- Recipient holds less than 10% of issued share capital of payer

**Application:**
- Solaris UK Ltd holds **5% of Solaris Research SA** (less than 10% threshold) ✓
- Assuming Solaris Research SA is not classified as a "small company" ✓

**Result:** Dividends received by Solaris UK Ltd from Solaris Research SA are **exempt** from UK Corporation Tax under s931G ✓

**Double Tax Relief (if applicable):**

If dividends were taxable in the UK (e.g., different exemption conditions):
- Solaris UK Ltd would be entitled to **foreign tax credit** for Spanish withholding tax suffered
- Credit limited to lower of: (i) foreign tax paid, or (ii) UK CT on foreign income
- Credit claimed under TIOPA 2010, Part 2 or under Spain-UK DTA

**Summary:**

| Payment Type | Direction | Withholding Tax | UK CT Treatment |

### Key Learning Points

1. **Day Counting is Critical**
   - Hospital stays only qualify for exceptional circumstances if **no choice**
   - Deliberate return to UK = days count
   - Always verify final day count before applying tests

2. **SRT is Hierarchical**
   - Must apply tests in order: AOT → AUT → STT
   - Cannot skip directly to ties test
   - Clear conclusion at each stage

3. **Sufficient Ties Requires Detailed Analysis**
   - Family tie: Must establish spouse's residence independently
   - Accommodation tie: Must actually **use** the accommodation (not just available)
   - Work tie: 40-day threshold is strict
   - 90-day tie: Look back 2 prior years

4. **DTA Tie-Breaker is Subjective**
   - Centre of vital interests requires balancing test
   - Personal and economic relations both matter
   - Nationality is final tie-breaker
   - Insufficient facts = arguable either way (state assumptions)

5. **TNR Rules Catch Prior Year Gains**
   - 4 of 7 year test before departure
   - Applies if return within 5 years
   - Gains on assets owned pre-departure taxed in return year
   - Close company dividends caught; public company dividends usually not

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Mistake 1:** Assuming hospital stays automatically qualify for exceptional circumstances
✅ **Correct:** Only if individual had **no choice** - deliberate return counts

❌ **Mistake 2:** Forgetting to establish spouse's residence independently
✅ **Correct:** Must apply full SRT to spouse to determine if family tie exists

❌ **Mistake 3:** Applying wrong sufficient ties table (arrivers vs leavers)
✅ **Correct:** Daniel is a leaver (resident in prior 3 years)

❌ **Mistake 4:** Stopping at permanent home test in DTA tie-breaker
✅ **Correct:** If homes in both countries, must continue through entire cascade

❌ **Mistake 5:** Assuming all income and gains caught by TNR
✅ **Correct:** Only certain types caught; public company dividends usually excluded

❌ **Mistake 6:** Not considering split year treatment
✅ **Correct:** Should mention as potential alternative (though not required here)

### Examiner's Preferred Approach

Based on suggested solutions:

1. **Structure Matters**
   - Use clear headings for each test
   - Show each step of the analysis
   - State conclusion at each stage before proceeding

2. **Application to Facts**
   - Don't just recite law - apply to scenario
   - Use specific numbers from question
   - Explain why test is/isn't met

3. **Balanced Analysis**
   - Where facts are insufficient, say so
   - Present arguments on both sides
   - State which way you lean and why

4. **Professional Presentation**
   - Use proper section references (FA 2013, Sch 45)
   - Number your conclusions
   - Use tables/bullet points for clarity

5. **Practical Consequences**
   - Always state the tax consequence of your conclusion
   - Quantify tax where possible
   - Mention reliefs/elections available
