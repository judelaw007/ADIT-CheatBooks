# Part A: Residence (Corporate and Individual) - TEMPLATE

## Question Recognition Triggers
- Individual relocating to/from UK
- Corporate entity with UK connections
- Questions about "tax residence"
- Scenarios involving multiple countries
- References to "Statutory Residence Test" or "central management and control"

## Time Allocation (25 marks = 45 minutes)
- Read and analyze: 5 minutes
- Plan structure: 3 minutes
- Write answer: 34 minutes
- Review: 3 minutes

## Answer Structure Template

### 1. Introduction and Issue Identification (2-3 marks, 5 minutes)
```
The key issue is to determine [individual's/company's] tax residence status for UK tax purposes
for the [relevant] tax year(s). This will determine the scope of their UK tax liability.

[If relevant: The residence status affects taxation on [worldwide income/UK source income only]]
```

### 2. Corporate Residence Analysis (if applicable) (8-10 marks, 12-15 minutes)

#### A. Common Law Test - Central Management and Control
```
Under common law, a company is UK resident if its central management and control (CMC)
is exercised in the UK (De Beers Consolidated Mines v Howe).

CMC is where strategic decisions are made, typically at board level.

Facts to analyze:
- Location of board meetings
- Where key strategic decisions made
- Residence of directors
- Location of day-to-day management (less relevant)

Application to scenario:
[Analyze each factor based on given facts]

Conclusion: CMC is exercised in [jurisdiction] because...
```

#### B. Statutory Test - Place of Incorporation
```
Under CTA 2009, s. 14, a company incorporated in the UK is automatically UK resident
from 15 March 1988 onwards (subject to treaty override).

Application:
[State where company incorporated and date]

Conclusion: [Company] is/is not UK resident under the statutory test.
```

#### C. Double Tax Treaty Considerations (if applicable)
```
Where a company is resident in multiple jurisdictions, the tie-breaker article in the
relevant DTT applies (typically Article 4 OECD Model).

Treaty tie-breaker uses "place of effective management" (POEM) test.

Application:
[Analyze POEM based on facts]

Conclusion: Under the DTT, [Company] is resident in [jurisdiction].
```

### 3. Individual Residence Analysis (if applicable) (8-10 marks, 12-15 minutes)

#### A. Automatic Overseas Tests (AOT)
```
Individual is conclusively non-UK resident if meets any AOT (FA 2013, Sch. 45):

AOT1: In UK fewer than 16 days (was non-resident in prior 3 years)
AOT2: In UK fewer than 46 days (was UK resident in one or more of prior 3 years)
AOT3: Works full-time overseas with UK presence under 91 days

Analysis:
[Check each AOT against facts]
- Days in UK: [X] days
- Prior year residence: [status]
- Work pattern: [details]

Conclusion: [Individual] does/does not meet AOT [number]
```

#### B. Automatic UK Tests (AUT) (if not conclusively non-resident)
```
Individual is conclusively UK resident if meets any AUT:

AUT1: In UK for 183 days or more
AUT2: Has only home in UK (or UK + overseas homes but stays only in UK home)
AUT3: Works full-time in UK

Analysis:
[Check each AUT against facts]
- Days in UK: [X] days
- Homes: [locations and use]
- Work pattern: [details]

Conclusion: [Individual] does/does not meet AUT [number]
```

#### C. Sufficient Ties Test (if neither AOT nor AUT applies)
```
If no conclusive test applies, residence depends on UK ties combined with days in UK.

UK Ties (5 ties for previously resident, 4 for never resident):
1. Family tie: Spouse/minor children UK resident
2. Accommodation tie: Available accommodation in UK
3. Work tie: Substantive UK work (40+ days)
4. 90-day tie: UK presence 90+ days in either of prior 2 years
5. Country tie: More days in UK than any other single country (arrivers only)

Analysis:
[Assess each tie]:
- Family tie: [Yes/No - details]
- Accommodation tie: [Yes/No - details]
- Work tie: [Yes/No - details]
- 90-day tie: [Yes/No - details]
- Country tie: [Yes/No - details if relevant]

Total ties: [X]
Days in UK: [Y]

Apply sufficient ties table:
[State applicable table - previously resident vs. arriver]
[Cross-reference days and ties]

Conclusion: [Individual] is/is not UK resident for [tax year]
```

### 4. Tax Consequences (3-5 marks, 7-10 minutes)
```
Based on residence determination above:

If UK resident:
- Subject to UK tax on worldwide income (ITA 2007, s. 1)
- Subject to UK CGT on worldwide gains (TCGA 1992, s. 1)
- May claim double tax relief under DTT or unilateral relief

If non-UK resident:
- Subject to UK tax on UK source income only
- Subject to UK CGT on limited assets (UK property, etc.)
- Treaty may reduce/eliminate UK withholding taxes

Specific implications for this case:
[Apply to scenario - discuss specific income/gains]
[Mention any planning opportunities or anti-avoidance considerations]
```

### 5. Conclusion (1-2 marks, 3 minutes)
```
In conclusion, [individual/company] is/is not UK resident for [period] because [summarize key reason].

This means they will be subject to [scope of UK taxation].

[Any recommendations or further considerations]
```

## Key Legislation References
- **Corporate**: CTA 2009, s. 14; case law: De Beers, Untelrab, Laerstate
- **Individual**: FA 2013, Sch. 45 (Statutory Residence Test)
- **Treaty**: OECD Model Articles 4 (residence) and relevant bilateral DTTs

## Common Variations
1. Split year treatment (if individual arrives/leaves mid-year)
2. Temporary non-residence rules (if brief departure)
3. Treaty residence + UK domestic residence conflict
4. Corporate migration scenarios
5. Dual resident individuals/companies

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't confuse domicile with residence
- Always check BOTH statutory and common law tests for companies
- Count days carefully (day of arrival counts, day of departure doesn't)
- Consider ALL ties, not just obvious ones
- Don't forget treaty override provisions
- Apply correct table for sufficient ties test (arriver vs. previously resident)

## Marking Scheme Breakdown (Typical)
- Issue identification: 2-3 marks
- Legal framework (rules stated correctly): 5-6 marks
- Application to facts: 10-12 marks
- Conclusion and tax consequences: 5-6 marks
- Professional presentation: 1-2 marks
