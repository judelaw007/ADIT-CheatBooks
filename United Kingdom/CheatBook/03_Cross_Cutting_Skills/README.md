## Key Principles

### Time Management
**The 80/20 Rule**: 80% of marks come from 20% of your time spent on high-value activities
- Prioritize questions you're confident about
- Don't get stuck on one difficult point
- Always attempt all required questions (even partially)

**Time Allocation**:
- Part A (2 questions): 90 minutes (50 marks)
- Part B (1 question): 36 minutes (20 marks)
- Part C (2 questions): 54 minutes (30 marks)
- Total writing time: 180 minutes
- Build in 5-10 minute buffer

### Answer Structure Excellence

**IRAC Method** (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion):
1. **Issue**: Identify the tax issue/question
2. **Rule**: State the relevant law/rule
3. **Application**: Apply the rule to the facts
4. **Conclusion**: Provide a clear answer

**Professional Presentation**:
- Use headings and subheadings
- Number your points
- Keep paragraphs focused (one idea per paragraph)
- Use technical language correctly
- Show your working in calculations

### Legislation Analysis

**The FIND Method**:
- **F**act pattern recognition
- **I**dentify relevant provisions
- **N**arrow down to specific sections
- **D**etermine application to scenario
