# CHAPTER 03: CROSS-CUTTING SKILLS
## The Skills That Transform Knowledge Into Marks

---

## Introduction: Why Skills Matter More Than Knowledge

The ADIT UK Module 2.09 exam tests **application**, not memory. Many candidates with excellent technical knowledge fail because they cannot:
- Structure answers within time constraints
- Navigate legislation efficiently
- Perform calculations accurately under pressure
- Apply case law appropriately
- Interpret treaty provisions correctly

This chapter provides **practical frameworks** to develop these skills systematically.

# SECTION 3.1: TIME MANAGEMENT MASTERY

## The Brutal Mathematics of the ADIT Exam

| Component | Marks | Time Allocation | Minutes per Mark |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| Part A (Compulsory) | 50 | 90 minutes | 1.8 min |
| Part B (Choice of 1) | 20 | 36 minutes | 1.8 min |
| Part C (Choice of 1) | 30 | 54 minutes | 1.8 min |
| **Total** | **100** | **180 minutes** | **1.8 min** |

**Critical Insight**: You have exactly 1.8 minutes per mark. Every minute spent on a 2-mark question beyond 3.6 minutes is stolen from another question.

---

## Part A Time Allocation (90 Minutes for 50 Marks)

### Structure Pattern Analysis
Part A typically contains 5-6 sub-questions covering multiple topics:

| Sub-Question Type | Typical Marks | Time Budget | Strategy |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| Residence status | 8-12 marks | 15-22 min | Use statutory test flowchart |
| Treaty application | 6-10 marks | 11-18 min | Article-by-article approach |
| CFC/Transfer Pricing | 8-12 marks | 15-22 min | Gateway test + technical |
| Employment income | 6-10 marks | 11-18 min | Step-by-step calculation |
| Anti-avoidance | 4-8 marks | 7-14 min | GAAR/TAAR identification |

### The 90-Minute Part A Blueprint

```
MINUTES 0-5:    Read ALL questions, identify topics, note mark allocations
MINUTES 5-20:   Question (a) - typically residence/domicile
MINUTES 20-35:  Question (b) - typically treaty or international
MINUTES 35-50:  Question (c) - typically CFC/TP/technical
MINUTES 50-65:  Question (d) - typically employment/income
MINUTES 65-80:  Question (e) - typically anti-avoidance/other
MINUTES 80-90:  Review, add points, check calculations
```

---

## Part B Time Allocation (36 Minutes for 20 Marks)

### The 36-Minute Part B Blueprint

Part B questions are essay-style, testing depth on ONE topic:

```
MINUTES 0-3:    Read question carefully, identify ALL requirements
MINUTES 3-5:    Plan answer structure (quick bullet points)
MINUTES 5-30:   Write structured answer
MINUTES 30-36:  Review, add missing points, check coherence
```

### Part B Answer Density Target

| Question Requirement | Marks | Points Needed | Time |
|---------------------|-------|---------------|------|
| "Explain the rules" | 8 | 4-5 distinct points | 14 min |
| "Discuss conditions" | 6 | 3-4 conditions | 11 min |
| "Calculate with explanation" | 6 | Calc + 3 explanations | 11 min |

---

## Part C Time Allocation (54 Minutes for 30 Marks)

### The 54-Minute Part C Blueprint

Part C combines technical depth with practical application:

```
MINUTES 0-5:    Read scenario, identify all issues, note entities
MINUTES 5-10:   Plan approach, list topics to cover
MINUTES 10-45:  Write answer section by section
MINUTES 45-54:  Review, verify calculations, add missing analysis
```

### Part C Typical Structure

| Section | Typical Content | Marks | Time |
|---------|-----------------|-------|------|
| Opening | Issue identification | 2-3 | 4 min |
| Main analysis 1 | Primary topic | 10-12 | 18 min |
| Main analysis 2 | Secondary topic | 8-10 | 15 min |
| Calculations | Numbers + workings | 6-8 | 12 min |
| Conclusion | Advice summary | 2-3 | 5 min |

---

## Time Management Decision Trees

### When Running Behind Schedule

```
IF behind by 5+ minutes:
    → Stop current question at next logical break
    → Move to next question
    → Return if time permits

IF behind by 10+ minutes:
    → Immediately stop current question
    → Write bullet points for remaining content
    → Move to next question

IF behind by 15+ minutes:
    → Complete remaining questions in bullet form
    → Prioritize highest-mark questions
```

### Mark Maximisation Under Time Pressure

**Priority Matrix:**

| Question Status | Marks Available | Action |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Untouched | High (10+) | Tackle immediately in bullet form |
| Untouched | Medium (5-9) | Brief answer, key points only |
| Untouched | Low (1-4) | One-line answer if possible |
| Partial | Any | Add quick bullet points |

# SECTION 3.2: LEGISLATIVE ANALYSIS

## The Art of Statutory Interpretation

UK tax law requires precise legislative analysis. The examiner expects you to:
1. **Identify** the relevant statute
2. **Quote** key conditions accurately
3. **Apply** to the facts methodically
4. **Conclude** with statutory support

---

## Key Legislative Sources for Module 2.09

### Primary Legislation

| Act | Abbreviation | Key Topics |
|-----|--------------|------------|
| Income Tax Act 2007 | ITA 2007 | Personal allowances, rates, reliefs |
| Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 | TCGA 1992 | CGT, reliefs, exemptions |
| Corporation Tax Act 2009 | CTA 2009 | Corporate income, loan relationships |
| Corporation Tax Act 2010 | CTA 2010 | Groups, losses, CFC |
| Taxation (International and Other Provisions) Act 2010 | TIOPA 2010 | Transfer pricing, DTAs, DTC |
| Inheritance Tax Act 1984 | IHTA 1984 | IHT, settlements, BPR |
| Finance Act 2013 | FA 2013 | SRT (Schedule 45) |
| Finance Act 2015 | FA 2015 | Diverted Profits Tax |
| Finance Act 2022 | FA 2022 | Various updates |

---

## Legislative Interpretation Framework

### The SCAR Method

**S** - Statute: Identify the relevant Act and section
**C** - Conditions: List all statutory conditions
**A** - Application: Apply each condition to facts
**R** - Result: State the statutory outcome

### Example: CFC Gateway Test (TIOPA 2010)

**S** - TIOPA 2010, Part 9A, Chapter 3

**C** - Gateway conditions (must pass at least one to be exempt):
1. Low profits exemption (s.371NA)
2. Low profit margin exemption (s.371NB)
3. Tax exemption (s.371NC)
4. Excluded territories exemption (s.371ND)
5. Low accounting profit exemption (s.371NE)

**A** - For each gateway, check:
- Are the specific conditions met?
- What evidence supports this?

**R** - "The CFC [passes/fails] the [specific] gateway because..."

---

## Statutory Condition Checklists

### Residence Status (FA 2013, Schedule 45)

**Automatic Overseas Test (s.A)**:
- [ ] Present in UK <16 days (previously resident)
- [ ] Present in UK <46 days (not previously resident)
- [ ] Works overseas full-time, UK presence <91 days, UK workdays <31

**Automatic UK Test**:
- [ ] Present in UK ≥183 days
- [ ] Only home in UK (≥30 days in UK)
- [ ] Works full-time in UK (≥365-day period)

**Sufficient Ties Test (if no automatic test met)**:
- [ ] Family tie (spouse/civil partner/minor child UK resident)
- [ ] Accommodation tie (available ≥91 days, used ≥1 day)
- [ ] Work tie (≥40 UK workdays)
- [ ] 90-day tie (>90 UK days in either prior year)
- [ ] Country tie (UK is country of greatest presence)

---

### Transfer Pricing Adjustment (TIOPA 2010, Part 4)

**Conditions for Adjustment (s.147)**:
- [ ] Provision made between two affected persons
- [ ] Participation condition met (one controls other OR third controls both)
- [ ] Actual provision differs from arm's length provision
- [ ] UK taxable profits reduced OR UK tax loss increased

**Exemptions**:
- [ ] Small and medium enterprise exemption (s.166)
- [ ] Dormant company exemption
- [ ] Compensating adjustment available (s.174)

---

### Corporate Interest Restriction (TIOPA 2010, Part 10)

**When CIR Applies**:
- [ ] Worldwide group exists
- [ ] Group has UK companies with net interest expense
- [ ] Aggregate net tax-interest exceeds £2m de minimis

**Calculation Framework**:
1. Calculate tax-interest expense
2. Calculate tax-interest income
3. Net tax-interest = expense - income
4. If net > £2m → apply restriction rules
5. Fixed ratio limit = 30% × tax-EBITDA
6. Group ratio alternative (if elected)

---

## Statutory Language Precision

### Words That Matter

| Term | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| "shall" | Mandatory requirement | "shall be treated as resident" |
| "may" | Discretionary power | "HMRC may make a determination" |
| "and" | All conditions required | "UK resident AND domiciled" |
| "or" | Any condition sufficient | "resident OR ordinarily resident" |
| "wholly and exclusively" | Strict test | "wholly and exclusively for business" |
| "mainly" | >50% test | "mainly for trading purposes" |
| "substantial" | Usually 20%+ | "substantial shareholding" |

### Common Statutory Thresholds

| Threshold | Percentage | Context |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Control | ≥50% | Company control tests |
| Associate participation | ≥25% | Transfer pricing |
| Substantial shareholding | ≥10% | SSE relief |
| Material interest | ≥5% | Close company rules |
| Significant influence | ≥20% | Associated companies |
| Group relationship | 75% | Group relief |
| Consortium | 5-75% | Consortium relief |

---

## Legislative Analysis Exercises

### Exercise 3.2.1: Statute Identification

1. A UK company receives a dividend from a French subsidiary
2. An individual claims entrepreneur's relief on share disposal
3. A multinational group is restructuring intercompany loans
4. A non-UK domiciled individual receives foreign income
5. A company claims relief for trading losses against total profits

**Answers**:
1. CTA 2009, Part 9A (distributions)
2. TCGA 1992, s.169H-169S (now BADR - FA 2020)
3. TIOPA 2010, Part 4 (transfer pricing) and Part 10 (CIR)
4. ITA 2007, Part 14 (remittance basis)
5. CTA 2010, Part 4 (loss relief)

---

### Exercise 3.2.2: Condition Matching

Match the conditions to the relief:

| Relief | Conditions |
|--------|------------|
| Group relief | (a) 10% holding for 12 months |
| SSE | (b) 75% ordinary share capital |
| Rollover relief | (c) Trade for 12 months pre-disposal |
| EIS relief | (d) New qualifying asset within 3 years |
| Entrepreneurs' relief (BADR) | (e) Unquoted trading company |

**Answers**: Group relief-b, SSE-a+c, Rollover relief-d, EIS relief-e, BADR-5% holding + officer/employee

---

# SECTION 3.3: CALCULATION EXCELLENCE

## The Calculation Mindset

Examiner expectations for calculations:
- **Workings**: Always show your working, even for simple calculations
- **Labels**: Label each number clearly
- **Units**: Include £ symbols and state "per annum" etc.
- **Rounding**: Follow standard UK conventions
- **Logic**: Show the logical flow of the calculation

## Common Calculation Errors and Prevention

| Error Type | Example | Prevention |
|------------|---------|------------|
| Wrong tax year rates | Using old car benefit % | Write tax year at top of calculation |
| Missing benefit | Forgetting fuel benefit | Use checklist of all BIK types |
| Wrong base | % of cost not list price | Always state "list price" clearly |
| Double counting | Including item twice | Tick off items as calculated |
| Sign error | Adding instead of deducting | Check +/- logic before writing |
| Threshold confusion | Wrong AEA amount | Verify current year figures |
| Apportionment | Full year when part year | State period at top |

## Speed Calculation Drills

### Drill 3.3.A: Company Car (Target: 2 minutes)

Calculate the company car benefit:
- List price: £45,000
- CO2: 120 g/km
- Petrol engine
- Tax year: 2023/24
- Fuel provided for private use

**Solution**:
```
List price: £45,000
CO2 120g/km: Base 2% + (120-50)/5 × 1% = 2% + 14% = 16%
Car benefit: £45,000 × 16% = £7,200
Fuel benefit: £27,800 × 16% = £4,448
Total benefit: £11,648
```

### Drill 3.3.B: Capital Gain (Target: 3 minutes)

Calculate the chargeable gain:
- Proceeds: £500,000
- Acquisition cost (2010): £150,000
- Enhancement (2015): £50,000
- Selling costs: £10,000
- Company asset, sold December 2023

**Solution**:
```
Proceeds                     500,000
Less: Selling costs         (10,000)
                           --------

- UK duties (April-July): £30,000
- Overseas duties (Aug-March): £80,000

Calculate her UK taxable employment income.

**Solution**:
```
Split year treatment applies - Case 1 (starting full-time work overseas)

UK part: 6 April 2023 - 14 July 2023
Overseas part: 15 July 2023 - 5 April 2024

UK taxable income:
- UK duties (UK part): £30,000 - fully taxable
- Overseas duties (UK part): £NIL (none in this period)
- UK duties (overseas part): £NIL
- Overseas duties (overseas part): £NIL (not taxable)

Total UK taxable: £30,000
```

## The IRAC Method for Tax Answers

**I** - Issue: What is the tax question to be resolved?
**R** - Rule: What legislation/case law applies?
**A** - Application: How do the rules apply to these facts?
**C** - Conclusion: What is the outcome/advice?

### IRAC Example: Residence Question

**Issue**: Is James UK resident for 2023/24?

**Rule**: UK residence is determined under the Statutory Residence Test (FA 2013, Schedule 45). An individual is UK resident if they meet an automatic UK test, or fail an automatic overseas test and have sufficient UK ties.

**Application**:
- James was in the UK for 180 days - this is below 183 days so the automatic UK test is not met
- He has a UK home available for >91 days and used it - automatic UK test (only home) may apply
- If not automatic, sufficient ties test applies with 4 ties for a leaver...

**Conclusion**: James is UK resident for 2023/24 because [specific test met].

## Before and After Examples

### Example 3.4.1: Residence Answer

**BEFORE (Weak Answer)**:
"James came to the UK and worked here. The SRT says you are resident if you have 183 days. James had less than that so might not be resident. But he has ties like accommodation and work. So he might be resident."

**Problems**: Vague, no statutory reference, unclear application, weak conclusion.

**AFTER (Strong Answer)**:
"James's UK residence status for 2023/24 must be determined under the Statutory Residence Test (FA 2013, Schedule 45).

**Automatic Tests**:
James was present in the UK for 180 days, which is below the 183-day threshold for the automatic UK test (para 7). He does not meet any automatic overseas test as he has UK workdays exceeding 30.

**Sufficient Ties Test**:
As no automatic test is conclusive, the sufficient ties test applies (para 18). James has:
- Accommodation tie: YES - London flat available >91 days, used >1 day
- Work tie: YES - 180 UK workdays exceeds 40-day threshold
- 90-day tie: NO - no prior UK presence

As an arriver with 2 ties and 180 UK days (121-182 day bracket), James requires 3+ ties to be resident. He has only 2 ties.

**Conclusion**: James is NOT UK resident for 2023/24 under the sufficient ties test."

### Example 3.4.2: Treaty Application

**BEFORE (Weak Answer)**:
"The treaty might apply because there's a DTA between UK and Germany. The company is probably resident in both places. Article 4 talks about residence. The treaty should give relief."

**AFTER (Strong Answer)**:
"**Treaty Residence - UK-Germany DTA Application**

**Issue**: Where is GermanCo Ltd treated as resident under the UK-Germany DTA?

**Dual Residence Situation**:
GermanCo is incorporated in Germany (resident under German domestic law) but has its place of effective management in the UK (resident under UK CTA 2009, s.14).

**Article 4(3) Tie-Breaker**:
For companies with dual residence, Article 4(3) of the UK-Germany DTA provides that residence is determined by place of effective management (POEM).

**Application**:
The facts indicate that:
- Board meetings are held in London
- Strategic decisions are made by UK-based directors
- Day-to-day management is exercised from UK

The POEM is therefore in the UK.

**Conclusion**: GermanCo is treated as UK resident under Article 4(3), meaning Germany must give relief as the source state for any double taxation."

## Case Law Citation Format

**Full citation** (first mention):
"In *IRC v Lysaght* [1928] AC 234, the House of Lords held that..."

**Short citation** (subsequent mentions):
"Following *Lysaght*, the test is..."

**Principle citation**:
"The principle from *De Beers v Howe* [1906] that a company is resident where its central management and control is exercised..."

---

## Using Cases Effectively

### DO:
- Cite the case name and year
- State the principle briefly
- Apply to your facts
- Show how facts are similar/different

### DON'T:
- Quote lengthy passages
- List cases without application
- Cite irrelevant cases
- Get the principle wrong

### Example of Good Case Application:

"The question is whether the bonus payment is taxable as employment income. In *Hochstrasser v Mayes* [1960], the House of Lords established that a payment is 'from' employment if it is paid as a reward for services or by reason of the employment relationship. Here, the £50,000 bonus was paid specifically for John's work on the merger project, directly connected to his employment duties. Following *Hochstrasser*, this is clearly employment income within ITEPA 2003, s.62."

## Case Law Exercises

### Exercise 3.5.1: Case Identification

Which case would you cite for:

1. Determining where a company is resident
2. Whether an expatriate allowance is taxable
3. Proving a change of domicile
4. Ignoring artificial steps in a transaction
5. The taxpayer's right to minimise tax

**Answers**:
1. *De Beers v Howe* [1906]
2. *Hochstrasser v Mayes* [1960]
3. *IRC v Bullock* [1976] or *Re Fuld (No 3)* [1968]
4. *Furniss v Dawson* [1984]
5. *IRC v Duke of Westminster* [1936]

---

### Exercise 3.5.2: Apply the Case

**Scenario**: HoldCo Ltd is incorporated in Jersey but all board meetings are held in London, where the CEO and CFO are based. The company argues it is not UK resident.

**Task**: Apply relevant case law to determine residence.

**Model Answer**:
"Under *De Beers Consolidated Mines v Howe* [1906], a company is resident where its 'central management and control' actually abides. This is not determined by the place of incorporation but by where the real top-level management decisions are made.

Following *Unit Construction v Bullock* [1960], we must look at where control is actually exercised, not where it theoretically resides. The fact that HoldCo is incorporated in Jersey is not determinative.

The evidence shows:
- Board meetings in London
- CEO and CFO based in London
- Strategic decisions made in UK

Applying *De Beers*, the central management and control is in the UK. HoldCo Ltd is therefore UK resident under CTA 2009, s.14(3)."

## Treaty Application Framework

### Step 1: Determine Treaty Applicability
- Does a treaty exist between the countries?
- Does it cover the taxpayer? (Article 1)
- Does it cover this tax? (Article 2)

### Step 2: Resolve Residence
- Is the person resident in one or both states?
- If dual resident, apply tie-breaker (Article 4)

### Step 3: Characterise the Income
- What type of income is it?
- Which article applies?

### Step 4: Allocate Taxing Rights
- Does source state have any right to tax?
- Is there a rate limitation?

### Step 5: Determine Relief Method
- Article 23A (exemption) or 23B (credit)?
- What relief does residence state give?

## Treaty Navigation Exercises

### Exercise 3.6.1: Dividend Withholding

**Scenario**: UKCo receives dividends of £100,000 from FrenchCo. UKCo owns 30% of FrenchCo.

**Task**: Determine the withholding tax position under the UK-France treaty.

**Answer**:
```
Step 1: UK-France DTA applies
Step 2: UKCo is UK resident, FrenchCo is French resident
Step 3: This is dividend income - Article 10
Step 4: Article 10(2) - Beneficial owner holding ≥10% = 0% WHT
        (UK-France treaty - check specific provisions)
Step 5: UK exempts foreign dividends (CTA 2009 Part 9A)

Result: No French WHT (or reduced rate), UK exemption applies
```

---

### Exercise 3.6.2: Employment Income

**Scenario**: Klaus, a German resident, works for GermanCo but is assigned to the UK office. In 2023/24:
- UK days: 100
- Salary paid by GermanCo from Germany
- No UK PE of GermanCo

**Task**: Which state can tax Klaus's UK employment income?

**Answer**:
```
Step 1: UK-Germany DTA applies
Step 2: Klaus is German resident under Article 4
Step 3: Employment income - Article 15
Step 4: Article 15(2) exemption test:
        (a) Present in UK ≤183 days in any 12-month period? YES (100 days)
        (b) Remuneration paid by non-UK resident employer? YES
        (c) Remuneration not borne by UK PE? YES

All three conditions met - Article 15(2) exemption applies

Result: ONLY Germany can tax Klaus's employment income.
UK has no taxing rights under the treaty.
```

---

### Exercise 3.6.3: Permanent Establishment

**Scenario**: USCo has a UK sales representative who:
- Works from a UK home office
- Negotiates and concludes contracts with UK customers
- Reports to US management

**Task**: Does USCo have a UK PE under the UK-US treaty?

**Answer**:
```
Article 5 Analysis:

Fixed Place PE (Article 5(1))?
- Home office could be fixed place
- But is it "at the disposal of" USCo?
- Likely not a fixed place PE alone

Agency PE (Article 5(5))?
- Is the representative a dependent agent? YES (exclusive)
- Does he have authority to conclude contracts? YES
- Does he habitually exercise that authority? YES (regular sales)
- Article 5(6) exclusion? NO - not independent agent

Conclusion: USCo has a UK PE through its dependent agent.
UK can tax profits attributable to the PE under Article 7.
```

## Treaty Interpretation Principles

### Vienna Convention Rules
1. **Ordinary meaning** of terms in context
2. **Object and purpose** of the treaty
3. **Subsequent practice** of the parties
4. **OECD Commentary** (persuasive but not binding)

### Key UK Principles
- UK courts give significant weight to OECD Commentary
- *Sun Life v Pearson* - treaties interpreted generously
- *Memec v IRC* - POEM means highest level of control
- *Smallwood v HMRC* - treaty residence and abuse
