# Chapter 2: The Strategic Landscape

## Purpose of This Chapter

This chapter provides the strategic intelligence needed to prioritise your study time and maximise marks. It identifies which topics deliver the highest return on investment, categorises question types you'll encounter, and maps how topics interconnect across the exam.

**Time to Master**: 2 hours initial read, ongoing reference throughout preparation

## 2.1 High-ROI Topic Identification

### The ROI Formula

Topic ROI = (Frequency × Typical Marks × Predictability) ÷ Difficulty

Based on analysis of **8 exam sittings (June 2022 - June 2025)**, topics are ranked by strategic value:

### Tier 1: CRITICAL TOPICS (Must Master)

| Topic | Frequency | Typical Marks | Part | ROI Score |
|-------|-----------|---------------|------|-----------|
| **PSA vs Concession** | 8/8 (100%) | 25 | A | ★★★★★ |
| **Carbon Tax/ETS** | 8/8 (100%) | 20 | B | ★★★★★ |
| **Interest Deductions/Thin Cap** | 7/8 (88%) | 15 | C | ★★★★☆ |
| **Transfer Pricing** | 5/8 (63%) | 25 | A | ★★★★☆ |

**Strategic Insight**: PSA vs Concession and Carbon Tax/ETS have appeared in **EVERY exam since 2022**. Mastering these two topics alone guarantees you can confidently tackle 45 marks (45% of the exam).

### Tier 2: HIGH VALUE TOPICS (Strong Focus)

| Topic | Frequency | Typical Marks | Part | ROI Score |

| **Tax Due Diligence** | 5/8 (63%) | 15-25 | A/C | ★★★★☆ |
| **Tax Treaties** | 5/8 (63%) | 20-25 | A/B | ★★★☆☆ |
| **Permanent Establishments** | 4/8 (50%) | 15-20 | B/C | ★★★☆☆ |
| **Capital Gains** | 4/8 (50%) | 20 | B | ★★★☆☆ |

### Tier 3: MEDIUM VALUE TOPICS (Solid Understanding)

| Topic | Frequency | Typical Marks | Part | ROI Score |
|-------|-----------|---------------|------|-----------|
| **Fiscal Stability Clauses** | 3/8 (38%) | 20-25 | A/B | ★★★☆☆ |

| **Loss Recovery/Utilisation** | 3/8 (38%) | 15 | C | ★★☆☆☆ |

### Tier 4: LOWER FREQUENCY TOPICS (Basic Coverage)

| Topic | Frequency | Typical Marks | Part | ROI Score |
|-------|-----------|---------------|------|-----------|
| **Leasing** | 2/8 (25%) | 15 | C | ★★☆☆☆ |
| **Governance Regimes** | 2/8 (25%) | 15-20 | B/C | ★★☆☆☆ |
| **Trading/Derivatives** | 1/8 (13%) | 25 | A | ★★☆☆☆ |

## 2.5 Common Examiner Expectations and Pet Peeves

### What Examiners Want to See

Based on analysis of suggested solutions (2022-2025):

#### Structure and Presentation
✅ **Clear headings** matching question parts
✅ **Numbered points** for list-based questions
✅ **Logical flow** from definition → explanation → application
✅ **Balanced coverage** across all question parts
✅ **Professional advisory tone** (as if advising a client)

#### Content Expectations
✅ **Technical accuracy** in definitions and concepts
✅ **Practical application** to scenario facts
✅ **Multiple perspectives** (government vs IOC, advantages vs disadvantages)
✅ **Country/treaty examples** where relevant
✅ **Reference to OECD Guidelines** for transfer pricing and PE
✅ **Current awareness** (BEPS, climate policy developments)

#### Calculation Questions
✅ **Show all workings** clearly labelled
✅ **State assumptions** where data is ambiguous
✅ **Check arithmetic** before moving on
✅ **Interpret results** (don't just give numbers)

### Common Mistakes That Lose Marks

#### Content Errors
❌ **Confusing PSA and Concession** mechanics (cost oil vs royalty)
❌ **Mixing up Carbon Tax and ETS** characteristics
❌ **Incomplete due diligence lists** (need 6-10 items, not 3-4)
❌ **Forgetting ring-fence implications** in regime discussions
❌ **Ignoring host government perspective** in fiscal regime questions

#### Structural Errors
❌ **Unbalanced answers** (spending 80% on Part 1, rushing Parts 2-3)
❌ **Missing sub-question parts** entirely
❌ **Wall of text** without clear structure
❌ **Repeating same points** in different sections

#### Time Management Errors
❌ **Overwriting** Part A questions at expense of Part C
❌ **Spending too long on calculations** without earning interpretation marks
❌ **Not attempting all 5 questions**

### Mark Maximisation Strategies

#### For Discussion Questions (Typical: "Discuss...", "Explain...")
- Use **1 mark = 1 distinct point** rule
- Provide **depth over breadth** where marks are concentrated
- Include **practical examples** to demonstrate understanding

#### For List Questions (Typical: "Identify 6 issues...", "Outline 10 items...")
- Aim for **marks + 2 items** to ensure coverage
- Keep each point **concise but complete**
- Use **consistent format** (e.g., all bullet points or all numbered)

#### For Calculation Questions
- **Label everything** (what you're calculating, what the inputs are)
- **Show the formula** before inserting numbers
- **Provide narrative** explaining what results mean

#### For Comparison Questions
- Use **table format** for side-by-side comparison
- Cover **minimum 6-8 dimensions** of comparison
- Include **clear conclusion** stating preference with reasoning
