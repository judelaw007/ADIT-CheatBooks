## 1.1 Exam Format Deep-Dive

### The Invariant Structure

The ADIT Module 3.04 (Energy Resources Option) exam has maintained a **consistent structure** across all sittings from 2022-2025. This predictability is your advantage.

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Duration** | 3 hours 15 minutes (195 minutes) |
| **Total Marks** | 100 marks |
| **Pass Mark** | 50 marks (50%) |
| **Distinction** | 70 marks (70%) |
| **Structure** | 3 Parts (A, B, C) |
| **Questions Required** | 5 questions total |
| **Format** | Online, typed responses |

### Part-by-Part Breakdown

#### **PART A: The Compulsory Core (50 marks)**

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Questions | 2 questions |
| Marks each | 25 marks |
| Total marks | 50 marks (50% of exam) |
| Choice | **NONE - Both compulsory** |
| Time allocation | ~48 minutes per question |

**Critical Insight**: Part A questions are typically **scenario-based** with multiple sub-parts. They test your ability to:
- Apply technical knowledge to realistic situations
- Perform calculations (PSA, government take, profit splits)
- Advise governments or companies on fiscal regime choices
- Analyse complex cross-border tax issues

**Historical Part A Topics (2022-2025):**

## 1.2 Mark Allocation Reality

### How Examiners Actually Award Marks

Understanding examiner behaviour is crucial. Based on suggested solutions analysis:

#### **The Point-Per-Mark System**

Examiners typically award **1 mark per distinct, relevant point**. A 25-mark question expects approximately 20-25 substantive points.

#### **Mark Distribution Principles**

| Answer Element | Approximate Marks |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Correct identification of issue | 1 mark |
| Explanation/discussion of issue | 1-2 marks |
| Application to scenario | 1-2 marks |
| Relevant example or authority | 1 mark |
| Calculation (if required) | Method marks + answer marks |
| Conclusion/recommendation | 1 mark |

#### **Calculation Questions: Method vs Answer**

For calculation questions (common in PSA/government take scenarios):

| Element | Mark Allocation |
|---------|-----------------|
| Setting up the calculation correctly | ~40% of marks |
| Applying correct rates/percentages | ~30% of marks |
| Arriving at correct final answer | ~20% of marks |
| Presentation/workings shown | ~10% of marks |

**Key Insight**: Even with a wrong final answer, you can score 70-80% of available marks through correct methodology. **ALWAYS show your workings**.

#### **Sub-Part Mark Allocation**

Questions are typically divided into sub-parts with explicit mark allocations:

**Example from June 2025 Q1 (25 marks):**
- Part 1): Key features of concession and PSAs (16 marks)
- Part 2): Which offers higher revenue (4 marks)
- Part 3): Other fiscal revenues/obligations (5 marks)

**Strategy**: Allocate your time proportionally. Don't spend 20 minutes on a 4-mark sub-part.

## 1.3 Time Boxing Strategy

### The Mathematics of Time Allocation

| Total Time | 195 minutes |
|------------|-------------|
| Reading/Planning | 10-15 minutes |
| Writing Time | 180-185 minutes |
| Minutes per Mark | ~1.8-1.9 minutes |

### Recommended Time Allocation by Part

| Part | Marks | Time Allocation | Minutes per Mark |
|------|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Reading/Planning** | - | 10-15 min | - |
| **Part A Q1** | 25 | 45-48 min | 1.8-1.9 |
| **Part A Q2** | 25 | 45-48 min | 1.8-1.9 |
| **Part B** | 20 | 36-39 min | 1.8-1.9 |
| **Part C Q1** | 15 | 27-29 min | 1.8-1.9 |
| **Part C Q2** | 15 | 27-29 min | 1.8-1.9 |
| **Review** | - | 5-10 min | - |
| **TOTAL** | 100 | 195 min | ~1.9 |

### The Golden Rules of Time Management

1. **Never exceed allocated time by more than 5 minutes** - Diminishing returns set in rapidly
2. **Attempt all required questions** - Partial marks on 5 questions beats perfect marks on 3
3. **Start with your strongest question** - Build confidence and bank marks early
4. **Monitor time at 45-minute intervals** - Adjust pace if falling behind

### Time Boxing Template

Use this template during the exam:

```
START TIME: _______

Part A Q1 (45 min): Start _______ | Target End _______ | Actual End _______
Part A Q2 (45 min): Start _______ | Target End _______ | Actual End _______
Part B   (36 min): Start _______ | Target End _______ | Actual End _______
Part C Q1 (27 min): Start _______ | Target End _______ | Actual End _______
Part C Q2 (27 min): Start _______ | Target End _______ | Actual End _______
Review   (10 min): Start _______ | END _______
```

### Time Recovery Tactics

If you fall behind schedule:

| Situation | Recovery Action |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 5-10 min behind | Reduce detail on low-mark sub-parts |
| 10-15 min behind | Use bullet points instead of prose |
| 15+ min behind | Answer final question in skeleton form (headings + key points only) |

## 1.4 Question Selection Decision Tree

### Part B Selection (Choose 1 from 2)

```
STEP 1: Read both questions fully (2-3 minutes)
         |
STEP 2: Identify the core topic of each
         |
         ├── Is one topic from your "mastered" list?
         |         |
         |         YES → Select that question
         |         |
         |         NO → Continue to Step 3
         |
STEP 3: Count sub-parts in each question
         |
         ├── Does one have more sub-parts?
         |         |
         |         YES → Prefer more sub-parts (easier partial marks)
         |         |
         |         NO → Continue to Step 4
         |
STEP 4: Identify question type
         |
         ├── Discursive (discuss, explain, analyse)
         ├── Calculation-based
         ├── Comparative (compare, contrast, differentiate)
         |
         → Select type you're strongest at
```

### Part C Selection (Choose 2 from 4)

```
STEP 1: Scan all 4 questions (3-4 minutes)
         |
STEP 2: Immediately eliminate any topic you cannot attempt
         |
STEP 3: From remaining questions, identify:
         |
         ├── Which topics are from your "mastered" list?
         ├── Which have favourable sub-part structures?
         ├── Which can you complete within 27 minutes?
         |
STEP 4: Select 2 questions + 1 backup
         |
STEP 5: Start with your strongest selection
```

### Topic Mastery Priority Matrix

Based on historical frequency and mark allocation, prioritise mastery in this order:

| Priority | Topic | Historical Frequency | Typical Part |
|----------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| 1 | PSA vs Concession/Royalty-Tax | Every sitting | A |
| 2 | Carbon Tax / ETS | Every sitting | B |
| 3 | Interest Deductions / Debt Push Down | Every sitting | C |
| 4 | Transfer Pricing | 4/5 sittings | A, B |
| 5 | Tax Due Diligence | 4/5 sittings | C |
| 6 | Tax Treaties | 4/5 sittings | A, B |
| 7 | Thin Capitalisation | 3/5 sittings | C |
| 8 | Ring-fencing | 3/5 sittings | C |
| 9 | Service Contracts | 3/5 sittings | A |
| 10 | Permanent Establishments | 3/5 sittings | B, C |
