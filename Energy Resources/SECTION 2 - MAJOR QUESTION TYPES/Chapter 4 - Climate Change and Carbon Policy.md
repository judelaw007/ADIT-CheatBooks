- **Energy sector impact** - direct effect on oil and gas companies

### The Examiner's Mental Model

The examiner wants you to demonstrate:
1. **Technical knowledge** - clear definitions and mechanisms
2. **Comparative analysis** - understanding trade-offs between instruments
3. **Practical application** - real-world implementation considerations
4. **International awareness** - cross-border effects and examples

## 4.3 Core Knowledge: Carbon Tax

### Definition (Examiner-Approved Language)
> "A carbon tax is an instrument of environmental cost internalisation. It is an excise tax on the producers of raw fossil fuels based on the relative carbon content of those fuels."

> "Under a carbon tax, the government sets a price that emitters must pay for each ton of greenhouse gas emissions they emit. Businesses and consumers will take steps, such as switching fuels or adopting new technologies, to reduce their emissions to avoid paying the tax."

### How Carbon Taxes Work

### Advantages of Carbon Taxes (8 Points for Exams)

| Advantage | Examiner-Approved Explanation |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| **1. Transparency and simplicity** | Carbon taxes are transparent, simple, and have wide coverage |
| **2. Quick implementation** | Can be quickly implemented by amending tax provisions |
| **3. Price predictability** | The related cost is predictable, providing stable price signals to assist businesses and consumers to plan energy spending |
| **4. Investment certainty** | Predicting cost offers certainty for investment in energy-efficiency with large initial costs |
| **5. Permanent incentive** | Acts as a permanent incentive to reduce emissions because the price of emissions does not change |
| **6. Market distortion avoidance** | Not susceptible to distortions in markets for trading emissions |
| **7. Clean energy motivation** | Increasing the cost of carbon-based fuels motivates companies to switch to clean energy |
| **8. Revenue generation** | Sources of revenues which can be used to compensate those most affected |

### Disadvantages of Carbon Taxes (5 Points for Exams)

| Disadvantage | Examiner-Approved Explanation |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| **1. Price inelasticity risk** | Carbon dioxide emissions may not decline if consumption remains unresponsive to price increase |
| **2. Rate uncertainty** | The rate of tax to produce the best outcomes is difficult to predict, may require several changes |
| **3. Lobbying for exemptions** | Lobby groups may be successful in securing exemptions for highly affected industries |
| **4. Regressive impact** | By making fossil fuels more expensive, it imposes a harsher burden on those with low incomes |
| **5. Carbon leakage** | Activities may relocate to a country that does not have carbon taxes |

---

## 4.4 Core Knowledge: Emissions Trading Schemes (ETS)

### Definition (Examiner-Approved Language)
> "An ETS – sometimes referred to as a cap-and-trade system – caps the total level of greenhouse gas emissions and allows those industries with low emissions to sell their extra allowances to larger emitters."

> "ETS is based on establishing tradable property rights to provide incentives to reduce emissions of GHGs."

### How ETS Works
```

│                    ETS MECHANISM                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Government sets EMISSIONS CAP (total quantity)        │
│           ↓                                             │
│  Allowances ALLOCATED or AUCTIONED to emitters         │
│           ↓                                             │
│  Emitters can TRADE allowances in market               │
│           ↓                                             │
│  Market determines CARBON PRICE                         │
│           ↓                                             │
│  Outcome: CERTAIN QUANTITY, UNCERTAIN PRICE            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key ETS Characteristics (Examiner-Approved Points)

| Characteristic | Explanation |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Cap setting** | Government sets a cap on the total amount of certain GHGs that can be emitted |
| **Large emitter focus** | Generally placed at the large user stage of the carbon cycle, such as power stations and manufacturing plants |
| **Trading flexibility** | By offering the ability to trade units, creates flexibility to improve economic efficiency |
| **Cost-effectiveness** | Cheaper for some entities to pay others to reduce their emissions if they have more cost-effective alternatives |
| **Revenue collection** | Allows revenues to be collected by governments to mitigate emissions risks and impacts |
| **Cap reduction over time** | The cap is reduced over time, so total emissions must fall |

## 4.5 Carbon Tax vs ETS Comparison

### Template 4A: Carbon Tax vs ETS Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Carbon Tax | Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) |
|---------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| **Price certainty** | ✓ Fixed price set by government | ✗ Price fluctuates with market |
| **Quantity certainty** | ✗ Emission reduction uncertain | ✓ Cap guarantees quantity limit |
| **Administrative complexity** | Lower - uses existing tax systems | Higher - requires trading infrastructure |
| **Political acceptability** | May face resistance (visible cost) | May be more acceptable (cost obscured) |
| **Revenue predictability** | ✓ Stable, predictable revenue | ✗ Revenue depends on allowance prices |
| **Implementation speed** | ✓ Can be quickly implemented | ✗ Requires longer setup time |
| **Market distortion risk** | ✓ Low risk | ✗ Susceptible to market manipulation |
| **Investment signal** | ✓ Stable long-term signal | ✗ Volatile price signal |
| **Sector coverage** | ✓ Can cover broad emissions sources | Usually focused on large emitters |

### The Fundamental Trade-Off

> **Key Insight**: "A carbon tax directly sets a price on carbon by defining a tax rate on greenhouse gas emissions. It is different from an ETS in that the emission reduction outcome of a carbon tax is not pre-defined but the carbon price is."

```
CARBON TAX:     Price = CERTAIN      Quantity = UNCERTAIN
ETS:            Price = UNCERTAIN    Quantity = CERTAIN
```

## 4.6 Four Benefits of Carbon Taxes (December 2024 Style Question)

### Template 4B: Benefits of Carbon Taxation Framework

When asked for benefits of carbon taxes, structure your answer around these four categories:

**1. Emission Reduction**
> "By attaching a significant price to pollution, it incentivises shifts towards less carbon intensive fuels, deployment of energy efficiency measures, and investment in clean alternatives across sectors like electricity, transportation, and manufacturing."

**2. Climate Change Mitigation**
> "It provides a continuous incentive for reducing emissions – including through innovation in green technologies – while generating revenues that can be reinvested and used for social transfers. With carbon taxes, companies can make a choice on the level and type of additional efforts they make to cut emissions, ensuring emissions are cut in the most efficient way and innovation is incentivised."

**3. Clean Energy Adoption**
> "In order to avoid paying carbon taxes, businesses will be incentivised to adopt clean energy options, thus reducing carbon emissions and their own costs. Wider adoption of renewable energy incentivises wider investment in renewable energy options."

**4. Green Initiative Funding**
> "Revenues from carbon taxes provide a sizeable funding pool that governments can utilise for investments in clean technology R&D, mass public transit upgrades, sustainable infrastructure projects, environmental restoration efforts, and resilience funds for vulnerable groups."

**5. Economic Efficiency (Bonus Point)**
> "Carbon taxes minimize the total cost to society of emission reductions. Greenhouse gases are classic negative externalities generating substantial costs borne by society at large. Carbon taxes cause emitters to internalize those costs."

## 4.7 Revenue Recycling Options

### Template 4E: Revenue Recycling Options Matrix

| Option | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| **Lump-sum dividends** | Return revenue equally to all citizens | Progressive, politically popular | Does not address efficiency |
| **Tax reduction** | Reduce other taxes (income, corporate) | "Double dividend" efficiency | May be less visible to public |
| **Green investment** | Fund clean energy R&D, infrastructure | Accelerates transition | May be poorly targeted |
| **Compensation payments** | Support affected workers/communities | Just transition | Administrative complexity |
| **Deficit reduction** | Pay down government debt | Fiscal prudence | No direct climate benefit |
| **International support** | Fund climate adaptation in developing countries | Global equity | Domestic political resistance |

---

## 4.8 Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)

### Template 4C: CBAM Analysis Framework

**What is CBAM?**
> "The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is the EU's tool to put a fair price on carbon emitted during the production of carbon-intensive goods entering the EU, and to encourage cleaner industrial production in non-EU countries."

### CBAM Timeline (Current as of 2025)
| Phase | Period | Key Features |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| **Transitional Phase** | 2023-2025 | Reporting obligations only, no financial payments |
| **Definitive Regime** | From 2026 | CBAM certificates required, linked to EU ETS prices |
| **Full Implementation** | By 2034 | Free EU ETS allowances fully phased out |

### CBAM Covered Sectors
- Iron and steel
- Cement
- Aluminium
- Fertilisers
- Electricity
- Hydrogen

### Tax Implications of CBAM

1. **For importers into EU**: Must purchase CBAM certificates reflecting embedded carbon
2. **For exporters to EU**: May claim credit for carbon prices paid in country of origin
3. **For oil and gas sector**: Indirect impact through energy-intensive customer base
4. **Double taxation risk**: Where carbon is priced both at source and at EU border

## 4.9 Methane Abatement Incentives

### Template 4D: Methane Abatement Framework

**Why Methane Matters for Oil & Gas**
- Methane is 80x more potent than CO2 over 20-year period
- Oil and gas operations significant source of methane emissions
- Venting, flaring, and fugitive emissions are key sources

### Tax Incentives for Methane Reduction

| Jurisdiction | Mechanism | Key Features |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| **US (Pre-2025)** | Methane Emissions Charge (IRA) | $900/tonne (2024), $1,200 (2025), $1,500 (2026) |
| **US (Post-2025)** | Charge postponed to 2034 | Repeal under Trump administration |
| **Canada** | Output-Based Pricing System | Covers methane from large emitters |
| **EU** | Methane Regulation (2024) | Mandatory leak detection and repair |

### Policy Approaches
1. **Direct charges/fees**: Financial penalty for excess methane emissions
2. **Reporting requirements**: Mandatory measurement and disclosure
3. **Performance standards**: Leak detection and repair (LDAR) requirements
4. **Financial incentives**: Grants for methane capture equipment

## 4.10 CCUS Tax Aspects

**Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS)** - Tax treatment considerations:

### US Section 45Q Tax Credit
| Storage Type | Credit (per tonne CO2) |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Geological storage (saline) | $85 |
| Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) | $60 |
| Direct air capture (DAC) + storage | Up to $180 |

### Canada CCUS Investment Tax Credit
| Activity | ITC Rate (2022-2030) | ITC Rate (2031-2040) |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Direct air capture equipment | 60% | 30% |
| Other CO2 capture equipment | 50% | 25% |
| Transportation/storage equipment | 37.5% | 18.75% |

**Note**: Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects are NOT eligible for Canada CCUS ITC.

## 4.12 Error Prevention

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| Confusing price and quantity certainty | Carbon tax = price certain; ETS = quantity certain |
| Saying ETS "taxes" emissions | ETS creates tradable property rights, not a tax |
| Forgetting regressive impact | Always mention distributional concerns of carbon taxes |
| Ignoring carbon leakage | Include relocation risk in disadvantages |
| Mixing up CBAM with carbon tax | CBAM is border adjustment, not a production tax |
| Stating ETS covers all emissions | ETS typically covers large emitters only |
| Forgetting revenue recycling | Both instruments generate government revenue |

### Examiner Pet Peeves

1. **Vague definitions**: Use precise language from suggested solutions
2. **Missing mechanisms**: Always explain HOW the instrument works
3. **One-sided analysis**: Present both advantages AND disadvantages
4. **No examples**: Reference real schemes (EU ETS, UK ETS, Canada carbon tax)
5. **Ignoring international dimension**: Consider cross-border effects

### Quality Check Before Submitting

- [ ] Did I define the term using examiner-approved language?
- [ ] Did I explain the mechanism, not just the concept?
- [ ] Did I provide balanced analysis (pros and cons)?
- [ ] Did I include real-world examples?
- [ ] Did I consider international/cross-border implications?
- [ ] Did I mention revenue use and recycling options?
