### Why Transfer Pricing Matters in Oil & Gas

| Factor | Impact | Exam Relevance |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **High Transaction Values** | Single cargo = $50-100m+ | Small pricing differences = major tax impact |
| **Integrated Value Chains** | Upstream to retail connected | Multiple intercompany transactions |
| **Volatile Commodity Prices** | Daily price fluctuations | Timing and benchmark selection critical |
| **High Tax Jurisdictions** | Resource nationalism | Aggressive tax authority scrutiny |
| **Complex Cost Structures** | Shared services, R&D, financing | Cost allocation challenges |

### OECD Transfer Pricing Methods Overview

| Method | Description | Oil & Gas Application | When Preferred |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **CUP** (Comparable Uncontrolled Price) | Compare to arm's length transactions | Crude oil, LNG sales | Quoted commodities with reliable benchmarks |
| **Cost Plus** | Cost + appropriate markup | Oilfield services, drilling | Service transactions with identifiable costs |
| **Resale Price** | Resale price - gross margin | Downstream product sales | Distribution/marketing activities |
| **TNMM** (Transactional Net Margin) | Net profit margin comparison | Routine activities | No reliable CUP, one-sided transactions |
| **Profit Split** | Divide combined profits | Integrated operations, unique intangibles | Both parties contribute unique value |

> **OECD 2022 Guidelines**: Risk should be allocated to the party that:
> 1. Has **control** over the risk (decision-making)
> 2. Has **financial capacity** to assume the risk
> 3. Actually **bears the consequences** if the risk materializes

**CUP Adjustment Categories**

```
ARM'S LENGTH PRICE = BENCHMARK PRICE ± ADJUSTMENTS

QUALITY ADJUSTMENTS:
├── API gravity differential: ±$0.50 - $3.00/bbl
├── Sulphur content (sweet vs sour): ±$1.00 - $5.00/bbl
└── Pour point/viscosity: ±$0.25 - $1.00/bbl

LOCATION/DELIVERY ADJUSTMENTS:
├── Freight costs: Market shipping rates
├── Insurance: 0.1% - 0.3% of cargo value
└── Terminal fees: $0.10 - $0.50/bbl

TIMING ADJUSTMENTS:
├── Pricing date vs delivery date: Forward curve adjustment
├── Payment terms: Financing cost adjustment
└── Quotation period: Average vs spot

VOLUME ADJUSTMENTS:
├── Large cargo discount: -$0.05 - $0.20/bbl
└── Small lot premium: +$0.10 - $0.30/bbl
```

**CUP Formula Example**:

```
Transaction: Nigerian Bonny Light crude sale to related Swiss trader

Benchmark:           Dated Brent                    $82.00/bbl
Quality adjustment:  Bonny Light premium            +$1.50/bbl
Location adjustment: FOB Nigeria vs FOB North Sea   -$2.00/bbl
Timing adjustment:   5-day quotation period         +$0.30/bbl
Volume adjustment:   1 million barrel cargo         -$0.10/bbl
                                                    ──────────
Arm's Length Price:                                 $81.70/bbl

### Worked Example 6.3: Dispute Resolution Strategy

**Scenario**:

Following an audit, the Nigerian FIRS has proposed a $150 million transfer pricing adjustment on crude oil sales from a Nigerian subsidiary to a related Singapore trading company. The adjustment is based on FIRS applying a different pricing benchmark.

**Question**: Advise on the dispute resolution options available.

**Model Answer Structure**:

```
1. UNDERSTAND THE ADJUSTMENT (3 marks)
   ├── FIRS position: Alternative benchmark used
   ├── Company position: Dated Brent with appropriate adjustments
   ├── Gap: $150 million proposed adjustment
   └── Potential double taxation: Singapore taxes same profits

2. DOMESTIC REMEDIES (4 marks)

   Step 1: FIRS Objection
   ├── File formal objection within 30 days
   ├── Present detailed TP analysis
   ├── Provide additional documentation
   └── Request review by senior officials

   Step 2: Tax Appeal Tribunal
   ├── If objection unsuccessful
   ├── Formal legal proceedings
   └── Time-consuming but may be necessary

3. TREATY-BASED REMEDIES (6 marks)

   Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP):
   ├── Check Nigeria-Singapore tax treaty exists ✓
   ├── File MAP request with both competent authorities
   ├── Timeframe: Within 3 years of first notification
   ├── Process:
   │   • Nigerian CA and Singapore CA negotiate
   │   • Aim to eliminate double taxation
   │   • Not binding obligation to resolve
   └── Duration: Typically 24-36 months

4. ADVANCE PRICING AGREEMENT (4 marks)

   For Future Transactions:
   ├── Consider bilateral APA (Nigeria-Singapore)
   ├── Provides certainty for 3-5 years
   ├── May include rollback to disputed years
   └── Caution: Nigeria APA process still developing

5. RECOMMENDED STRATEGY (3 marks)

## 6.6 Error Prevention

### Common Exam Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Correct Approach |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| **Using Cost Plus for commodities** | CUP is preferred when benchmarks exist | Always start with CUP for quoted commodities |
| **Ignoring adjustments** | Raw benchmark price is not arm's length | Apply quality, location, timing adjustments |
| **Forgetting documentation** | TP without documentation fails | Always mention contemporaneous documentation |
| **Single method analysis** | Examiners want comparison | Discuss why selected method beats alternatives |
| **Ignoring substance** | Profits must follow functions/risks | Address whether entity has economic substance |
| **Generic answers** | Oil & gas has specific considerations | Reference specific benchmarks (Brent, WTI) |

### Quality Assurance Checklist

Before submitting your transfer pricing answer:

- [ ] Have I identified all intercompany transactions?
- [ ] Have I performed a functional analysis (functions, assets, risks)?
- [ ] Have I justified my method selection with alternatives considered?
- [ ] For CUP: Have I identified benchmark AND adjustments?

| 10 marks | 18 minutes | Method selection + brief application |
| 15 marks | 27 minutes | Full analysis + worked calculation |
| 20 marks | 36 minutes | Comprehensive + dispute resolution |

### Power Phrases for Transfer Pricing Answers

**Method Selection**:
- "The CUP method is the most reliable as [commodity] has an active quoted market..."
- "Cost Plus is appropriate as the service provider functions are routine..."
- "Profit Split is necessary where both parties contribute unique intangibles..."

**Arm's Length Standard**:
- "The arm's length price is determined by reference to comparable uncontrolled transactions..."
- "Adjustments are required to enhance comparability for..."
- "The selected benchmark requires adjustment for quality, location, and timing differences..."

**Documentation**:
- "Contemporaneous documentation should include..."
- "The three-tiered documentation structure (Master File, Local File, CbCR) requires..."
- "Transfer pricing positions should be supported by benchmarking studies..."

**Dispute Resolution**:
- "To mitigate double taxation risk, MAP relief should be pursued under Article [X] of the treaty..."
- "A bilateral APA would provide prospective certainty..."
- "Domestic remedies should be exhausted before treaty-based mechanisms..."

## Chapter Summary

Transfer pricing questions in the Energy Resources exam test your ability to:

1. **Recognize** intercompany transactions and their TP implications
2. **Select** the appropriate method with justification
3. **Apply** the method with specific benchmarks and adjustments
4. **Document** the analysis for tax authority defense
5. **Resolve** disputes through MAP, APA, or arbitration

**Key Exam Success Factors**:
- CUP is default for commodities—know your benchmarks
- Always perform functional analysis before method selection
- Documentation is not optional—it's essential
- Address both domestic and treaty remedies for disputes
- Reference OECD Guidelines to demonstrate technical competence

> **Final Tip**: Transfer pricing answers should demonstrate PROCESS, not just conclusions. Show the examiner your analytical journey from transaction identification through method selection to arm's length determination.
