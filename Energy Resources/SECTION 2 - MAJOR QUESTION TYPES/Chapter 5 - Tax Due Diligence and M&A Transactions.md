## 5.2 Strategic Context

### Why M&A Questions Appear Frequently

1. **High Commercial Relevance**: Oil & gas M&A activity is significant - companies regularly buy/sell assets
2. **Complex Tax Issues**: Multiple tax types interact (income tax, CGT, stamp duty, WHT, VAT)
3. **Cross-Border Dimensions**: International structures create treaty and transfer pricing considerations
4. **Tests Multiple Syllabus Areas**: Integrates fiscal regimes, financing, international tax concepts

### The Purchaser's Perspective

When advising a **purchaser**, focus on:
- Identifying hidden tax liabilities in the target
- Structuring the deal to maximise future deductions
- Ensuring carry-forward losses/costs are preserved
- Minimising transaction taxes (stamp duty, transfer taxes)
- Optimising funding structure for interest deductibility

### The Seller's Perspective

When advising a **seller**, consider:
- Capital gains tax exposure (direct vs indirect transfer)
- Treaty benefits for reducing CGT
- Timing of disposal for tax efficiency
- Warranty and indemnity implications

### Key Principle: Tax Capacity

> **"Tax Capacity"** = The ability to effectively utilise tax deductions
>
> A purchaser may obtain a tax deduction in its own country, but may not be able to effectively use the deductions if it does not have significant taxable income.

This principle drives debt push down strategies - placing debt where it generates usable deductions.

## 5.3 The Comprehensive Tax Due Diligence Framework

### Category 1: Essential Tax Position

| Item | What to Review | Risk Indicators |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Exploration Expenses** | Treatment and recovery rules | Unrecovered costs, timing differences |
| **Capital Expenditure** | Depreciation methods and rates | Accelerated vs actual depreciation |
| **Carry-Forward Losses** | Tax losses under concession regime | Change of ownership restrictions |
| **Allowable Costs (PSC)** | Cost oil recovery position | Unrecovered costs, caps on recovery |
| **Repatriation of Profits** | Dividend WHT, branch remittance tax | High WHT rates, trapped cash |
| **Capital Gains** | CGT on exit, indirect transfer rules | Immovable property provisions |
| **Transfer Taxes** | Stamp duty on asset/share transfers | Who bears the cost (buyer/seller/shared) |
| **Indirect Taxes** | VAT treatment, customs duties | Irrecoverable VAT, import duties |

### Category 2: Ring Fence Considerations

| Issue | Description | Exam Application |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **Field Ring Fencing** | Losses from one field cannot offset profits from others | Reduces flexibility in loss utilisation |
| **Activity Ring Fencing** | Upstream losses cannot offset non-upstream profits | Limits group relief opportunities |
| **Interest Restrictions** | Interest deductions limited against ring fence income | Affects debt push down strategies |

### Category 3: Holding Structure Analysis

**Structure Options:**

```
Option 1: Branch Structure
┌─────────────────┐
│  Parent Company │
│   (Home Country)│
└────────┬────────┘
         │ Branch
┌────────▼────────┐
│   Operations    │
│ (Host Country)  │
└─────────────────┘

Option 2: Single Company Structure
┌─────────────────┐
│  Parent Company │
│   (Home Country)│
└────────┬────────┘
         │ 100% shares
┌────────▼────────┐
│   Subsidiary    │
│ (Host Country)  │
└─────────────────┘

Option 3: Double Company Structure
┌─────────────────┐
│  Parent Company │
│   (Home Country)│
└────────┬────────┘
         │ 100% shares
┌────────▼────────┐
│ Intermediate    │
│ Holding Company │
│ (Treaty Country)│
└────────┬────────┘
         │ 100% shares
┌────────▼────────┐
│   Operating Co  │
│ (Host Country)  │
└─────────────────┘
```

**Structure Selection Considerations:**

| Factor | Branch | Single Company | Double Company |
|--------|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Loss Utilisation** | Immediate at parent level | Local only (unless consolidation) | Complex - depends on jurisdictions |
| **Exit CGT** | Taxed as asset sale | Share sale - treaty dependent | May benefit from participation exemption |
| **WHT on Dividends** | N/A (remittance) | Direct treaty rate | Potentially reduced via intermediate |
| **Complexity** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Cost** | Low | Medium | Higher |

### Category 4: Partner Structures

When local or foreign partners are involved:
- Joint venture vs incorporated JV considerations
- Carried interest arrangements
- Farm-in/farm-out tax treatment
- Partner WHT obligations

### Category 5: Tax Leakage Calculation

**Essential Exam Technique:**

```
Starting Point:                     100% of Oil & Gas Income
Less: Royalties                     (X%)
Less: Profit Oil to Government      (X%)  [PSC regimes]
Less: Corporate Income Tax          (X%)
Less: Supplementary/Hydrocarbon Tax (X%)
Less: WHT on Dividends              (X%)
Less: WHT on Interest               (X%)
Less: WHT on Services/Royalties     (X%)
─────────────────────────────────────────
= Net After-Tax Cash to Parent      XX%
```

## 5.4 Interest Deductions and Debt Push Down

### The Core Principle

> Interest deductions are generally allowed to a company for the purchase of **assets** under tax and concession regimes, as the assets will generate taxable profits.
>
> It may be **more difficult** to obtain interest deductions to purchase **shares** in a target company – there may be restrictions where the related dividends are tax exempt under participation exemption provisions.

### Interest Deductibility by Regime Type

| Regime | Interest Deductibility | Key Issues |
|--------|----------------------|------------|
| **Tax/Concession** | Generally allowed for asset purchases | Purpose test may apply |
| **PSC** | Generally **NOT** allowable as cost oil | Financing costs excluded from recoverable costs |
| **Hybrid** | Varies | Check specific PSC terms |

### The PSC Challenge

**Critical Exam Point:**

> "The effective use of interest deductions in PSC regimes is more difficult. The PSC itself will generally exclude financing costs as allowable costs in determining cost oil."

**Solution:** Consider whether interest deductions on debt to acquire PSC licence interests can be made elsewhere in the multinational group – at a parent company level.

### Debt Push Down Strategy

**Objective:** Utilise interest deductions in Target Company to offset that company's profits.

**Implementation Steps:**

```
Step 1: Create SPV in Target Country
┌─────────────────┐
│ Purchaser Co    │
│ (Low tax/no     │
│  tax capacity)  │
└────────┬────────┘
         │ Capitalises
┌────────▼────────┐
│      SPV        │
│ (Target Country)│
└─────────────────┘

Step 2: SPV Borrows (External or Intercompany)
┌─────────────────┐      Loan      ┌─────────────┐
│      Bank       │───────────────▶│     SPV     │
│   or Parent     │                │             │
└─────────────────┘                └─────────────┘

Step 3: SPV Acquires Target
┌─────────────────┐
│      SPV        │
│  (with debt)    │
└────────┬────────┘
         │ Acquires 100%
┌────────▼────────┐
│  Target Company │
│  (Profitable)   │
└─────────────────┘

Step 4: Tax Consolidation
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│     Tax Consolidated Group      │
│  ┌───────────┐  ┌────────────┐ │
│  │    SPV    │  │   Target   │ │
│  │ (Losses)  │◄─┤  (Profits) │ │
│  └───────────┘  └────────────┘ │
│   Interest      Taxable        │
│   deductions    income         │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Requirements for Success:**
1. Target country must have tax consolidation/group relief
2. SPV and Target must be eligible to consolidate
3. Interest must be deductible under local rules
4. Thin capitalisation rules must be satisfied

### Timing Considerations

> "Care is needed with the timing of adding debt and related interest deductions. An upstream oil and gas target company may be in exploration or early production stages, with large carry-forward losses."

**Strategic Implication:** There may be an advantage in increasing related party debt at a **later stage** when the target company is profitable, and when the deductions can therefore be utilised.

---

## 5.5 Thin Capitalisation Rules

### Purpose and Mechanism

Thin capitalisation rules prevent companies from:
- Using excessive debt to erode the tax base
- Shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions via interest payments
- Claiming interest deductions disproportionate to economic activity

### Three Main Approaches (BEPS Action 4)

| Approach | Mechanism | Typical Threshold |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Fixed Ratio Rule** | Limits interest to % of EBITDA | 10-30% of EBITDA |
| **Debt-to-Equity Ratio** | Caps debt relative to equity | 1.5:1 to 3:1 |
| **Arm's Length Test** | Interest must be at arm's length rates | Transfer pricing principles |

### Current Global Standards (2024-2025)

| Jurisdiction | Primary Rule | Threshold |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| **OECD/BEPS** | Fixed ratio | 10-30% of EBITDA |
| **UK** | Fixed ratio | 30% of EBITDA |
| **Australia** | Fixed ratio (2024 reform) | 30% of EBITDA |
| **US (Section 163(j))** | ATI-based | 30% of ATI (EBITDA from 2024) |
| **Canada (EIFEL)** | Fixed ratio | 30% of adjusted taxable income |
| **Germany** | EBITDA-based | 30% of EBITDA |

### Related Party vs Third Party Debt

| Debt Type | Thin Cap Application | Key Considerations |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Related Party** | Usually subject to thin cap rules | Interest rate must be arm's length |
| **Third Party (Bank)** | Often NOT subject to thin cap | But may be caught if guaranteed by parent |
| **Back-to-Back Loans** | Treated as related party | Parent deposits with bank, bank lends to sub |

### Alternative Structures

When thin cap rules bite, consider:

1. **Increase Equity**: Capitalise subsidiary to meet debt-to-equity ratios
2. **Sale-Leaseback**: Operating lease payments may not be "interest"
3. **Debt Factoring**: Sell receivables at discount
4. **Fee Arrangements**: Treasury management fees (check local rules)
5. **Smaller Loan, Higher Rate**: If transfer pricing permits

## 5.6 Share vs Asset Deal Comparison

### Template 5B: Share vs Asset Deal Matrix

| Factor | Share Deal | Asset Deal |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **What Transfers** | Shares in company (entity continues) | Specific assets (licenses, equipment) |
| **Tax Losses** | Usually preserved (check change of ownership rules) | Do NOT transfer to buyer |
| **Cost Oil/Allowable Costs** | Preserved in target company | May need to reset |
| **Depreciation Base** | Historical cost (no step-up) | Market value (step-up possible) |
| **Goodwill** | No amortisation | Potentially amortisable |
| **Stamp Duty** | Often lower (on share value) | Often higher (on asset value) |
| **CGT for Seller** | Share disposal (treaty relief possible) | Asset disposal (source country tax) |
| **Hidden Liabilities** | Transfer with company | Do NOT transfer |
| **Government Consent** | May be required for change of control | Usually required for license transfer |
| **Complexity** | Lower | Higher |

### Asset Step-Up Opportunity

> "Review whether there is an opportunity to increase the value of transferred assets to their market values to allow increased future depreciation deductions as an asset step up for tax purposes."

**Methods to achieve step-up:**
1. Asset deal instead of share deal
2. Asset transfer post-acquisition (internal reorganisation)
3. Check if local rules permit revaluation

---

## 5.7 Capital Gains Tax Considerations

### Direct vs Indirect Transfers

| Transfer Type | Description | Tax Treatment |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Direct** | Sale of physical assets or licenses | Source country generally taxes |
| **Indirect** | Sale of shares in entity holding assets | Depends on treaty and domestic law |

### The 50% Immovable Property Rule

Many treaties (following OECD Model Art. 13(4)) allow source country taxation when:

> More than 50% of the company's value derives from **immovable property** in the source country

**Implication for Oil & Gas:** Most oil & gas companies derive substantial value from mineral rights (immovable property), so indirect transfers are often taxable in the host country.

### Treaty Planning for CGT

| Strategy | Mechanism | Risk |
|----------|-----------|------|
| **Intermediate Holding Co** | Use jurisdiction with favourable treaty | BEPS anti-avoidance (PPT, LOB) |
| **Participation Exemption** | Exit via jurisdiction with CGT exemption | Substance requirements |
| **Timing** | Dispose when values lower | Commercial constraints |

### Example 2: Interest Deductions and Debt Push Down (15 marks)

**Question:**
(a) Discuss the issues in obtaining interest deductions on loans used to acquire oil and gas assets under tax/concession regimes compared to PSC regimes. (7 marks)
(b) Explain how a debt push down structure can be used to utilise interest deductions. (8 marks)

**Model Answer:**

**(a) Interest Deduction Issues (7 marks)**

**Tax and Concession Regimes:**
- Interest deductions are generally allowed for the purchase of assets, as the assets will generate taxable profits
- May be more difficult to obtain interest deductions to purchase shares – restrictions may apply where dividends are tax exempt under participation exemption

**PSC Regimes:**
- The effective use of interest deductions is more difficult
- PSC contracts generally exclude financing costs as allowable costs in determining cost oil
- Interest is not recovered through the cost oil mechanism
- The issue is whether interest deductions on debt to acquire PSC licence interests can be made elsewhere in the group – potentially at parent company level

**Thin Capitalisation:**
- Many countries have thin capitalisation provisions restricting interest deductions on related party debt
- Third party debt (bank borrowings) often not subject to thin cap in many countries
- Need to assess debt-to-equity ratios or EBITDA-based limits (typically 30%)

**(b) Debt Push Down Structure (8 marks)**

**Objective:**
Use a debt push down structure to utilise interest deductions in Target Company to offset that company's profits.

**Structure:**
1. Purchaser Company establishes SPV in target country
2. SPV borrows funds (from bank or parent company)
3. SPV acquires Target Company shares (or assets)
4. SPV and Target Company form tax consolidated group

**Tax Analysis:**
- Purchaser Company may obtain deduction in its own country, but may not effectively use deductions if it lacks "tax capacity" (sufficient taxable income)
- By using SPV in target country, interest deductions arise locally
- Tax consolidation transfers losses from SPV (interest deductions) to offset profits in Target Company

**Key Requirements:**
- Target country must have tax consolidation or group relief
- Both entities must be eligible to consolidate
- Interest must be deductible under local rules
- Thin capitalisation rules must be satisfied

**Timing Considerations:**
- Care needed with timing of adding debt
- If Target Company is in exploration/early production with large carry-forward losses, there may be advantage in increasing debt at a later stage when the company is profitable and deductions can be utilised

---

### Example 3: Thin Capitalisation (10 marks)

**Question:** Explain thin capitalisation rules and how they may impact interest deductions in oil and gas acquisitions.

**Model Answer:**

**Purpose (2 marks):**
- Thin capitalisation rules are domestic provisions to prevent companies with small equity from contracting large amounts of related party debt
- Prevents accumulation of tax-deductible interest expense that reduces the host country tax base

**Mechanism (3 marks):**

*Debt-to-Equity Approach:*
- Many countries use debt-to-equity ratio to determine acceptable debt levels
- Typically around 3:1 (or 1.5:1 in stricter jurisdictions)
- Interest on debt exceeding the ratio is disallowed

*EBITDA-Based Approach (BEPS Action 4):*
- Net interest expenditure limited to percentage of EBITDA
- Typically 10-30% (most commonly 30%)
- Increasingly adopted globally (UK, Australia, Germany, US)

**Application to Related Party vs Third Party Debt (2 marks):**
- Related party debt: Generally subject to thin cap rules
- Third party debt: Often exempt, but may be caught if:
  - Parent company provides guarantee
  - Back-to-back loan arrangement exists

**Impact on Oil & Gas Acquisitions (2 marks):**
- May limit interest deductions on acquisition debt
- Particularly important for debt push down structures
- Need to model debt capacity before finalising funding structure
- Disallowed interest typically carried forward

**Alternative Structures (1 mark):**
- Increase equity to meet ratios
- Sale-leaseback arrangements
- Fee arrangements for treasury services

## 5.10 Error Prevention

### Common Mistakes in M&A Questions

| Error | Why It's Wrong | Correct Approach |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| Assuming interest always deductible | PSC regimes typically exclude financing costs from cost oil | Distinguish between concession and PSC treatment |
| Ignoring thin capitalisation | Interest deductions may be limited | Always mention thin cap as a constraint |
| Forgetting ring fencing | Losses may not be usable against other income | Check field/activity ring fencing |
| Omitting stamp duty | Can be significant transaction cost | Always include in due diligence |
| Assuming losses transfer in share deal | May be restricted on change of ownership | Check local loss preservation rules |
| Ignoring indirect transfer rules | CGT may apply to share sales | Check >50% immovable property rule |
| Missing treaty benefits | Can significantly reduce tax leakage | Always consider treaty position |
| Forgetting substance requirements | BEPS anti-avoidance can deny benefits | Note substance requirements for structures |

## 5.12 Exam Command Word Guide for M&A Questions

| Command | What to Do | Depth Required |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| "Prepare a due diligence checklist" | Bullet point list of items to review | Comprehensive, 15-20 items |
| "Discuss issues in..." | Analyse problems and considerations | Balanced discussion, pros/cons |
| "Explain how..." | Describe mechanism/process | Step-by-step explanation |
| "Advise on..." | Provide recommendations | Clear advice with reasoning |
| "Compare..." | Contrast two approaches | Structured comparison (table helpful) |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Tax due diligence questions require comprehensive coverage** - use the checklist template and cover all categories systematically

2. **Interest deductions differ by regime** - always distinguish concession (generally allowed) from PSC (generally not recoverable as cost oil)

3. **Debt push down requires tax consolidation** - explain the SPV mechanism and consolidation requirement

4. **Thin capitalisation is always relevant** - mention 30% EBITDA or debt-to-equity limits as constraints

5. **Share vs asset deals have different consequences** - losses, step-up, stamp duty, CGT all differ

6. **Indirect transfers can trigger CGT** - the >50% immovable property rule catches most oil & gas share sales

7. **Time your answer appropriately** - due diligence lists need breadth; interest deduction questions need depth
