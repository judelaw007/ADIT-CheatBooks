## 3.2 The Three Fiscal Regimes: Core Knowledge

### 3.2.1 Production Sharing Agreement (PSA/PSC)

**Definition**: A contractual arrangement where the government retains ownership of hydrocarbon resources but grants an IOC the right to explore and produce in exchange for a share of production.

**Key Characteristics**:

| Feature | PSA Mechanism |
|---------|---------------|
| **Ownership** | Government retains title to reserves (in-situ and extracted) |
| **Risk Bearer** | IOC bears ALL pre-production exploration and development risks |
| **Cost Recovery** | IOC recovers costs through "cost oil" from production revenue |
| **Profit Sharing** | "Profit oil" split between government and IOC (fixed % or sliding scale) |
| **Tax Treatment** | IOC pays corporate tax on its share of profit oil |
| **Asset Ownership** | Assets transfer to government immediately or upon cost recovery |
| **Duration** | Typically 20-30 years with extension options |

**The PSA Revenue Waterfall**:
```
Gross Revenue (Production x Price)
    |
    ├── Royalty (if applicable, taken first - typically 10-20%)
    |
    ├── Cost Oil (IOC cost recovery - may have ceiling e.g., 50-75%)
    |       ├── Opex recovered first
    |       └── Capex recovered second (various methods)
    |
    └── Profit Oil (remaining after cost oil)
            ├── Government Share (e.g., 60%)
            └── IOC Share (e.g., 40%)
                    └── Corporate Tax (on IOC's profit oil share)
```

**Countries Using PSA**: Indonesia (pioneer, 1966), Nigeria (offshore), Angola, Libya, Kazakhstan, Egypt, Malaysia, Azerbaijan, Timor-Leste, Guyana

### 3.2.2 Concession (Tax/Royalty) Regime

**Definition**: A grant by a government to an IOC of exclusive rights to explore and produce hydrocarbons in a defined area, with title to extracted resources transferring to the IOC.

**Key Characteristics**:

| Feature | Concession Mechanism |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Ownership** | Title to EXTRACTED oil/gas transfers to IOC (not in-situ reserves) |
| **Risk Bearer** | IOC bears all exploration and production risks with NO cost recovery guarantee |
| **Revenue Mechanism** | Royalty (% of gross production) + Corporate Tax (on profits) |
| **Cost Treatment** | Costs are EXPENSES against taxable income, not "recovered" |
| **Asset Ownership** | IOC owns assets during license; may transfer at end |
| **Duration** | Historically 50-99 years; modern concessions 20-40 years |
| **Ring-fencing** | Often applied to prevent cross-field loss offsetting |

**The Concession Revenue Flow**:
```
Gross Revenue (Production x Price)
    |
    ├── Royalty (% of gross revenue - e.g., 10-20%)
    |       └── Paid to government regardless of profitability
    |
    └── Remaining Revenue
            ├── Less: Operating Costs (Opex)
            ├── Less: Depreciation/Capital Allowances
            ├── Less: Other Allowable Deductions
            |
            └── = Taxable Profit
                    └── Corporate Tax (+ Special Petroleum Tax if applicable)
```

**Countries Using Concession**: UK, Norway, USA, Brazil (pre-salt has PSA), Australia, Canada, Netherlands

### 3.2.3 Service Contracts

**Definition**: Arrangements where the IOC provides technical services to the government/NOC and receives a fee, with the government retaining full ownership and control of resources.

| Type | Characteristics | Risk to IOC | Countries |
|------|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Pure Service** | Fixed fee for services regardless of discovery | LOW - guaranteed payment | Kuwait (some contracts) |
| **Risk Service** | Fee + cost recovery ONLY if commercial discovery made | HIGH - no discovery = no recovery | Iran (buy-back), Iraq, Venezuela |
| **Technical Service (TSC)** | Fee per barrel produced; government controls operations | MEDIUM | Iraq (traditional) |

**Key Distinction for Exams**:
- **Pure Service**: IOC is essentially a contractor; paid regardless of outcome
- **Risk Service**: IOC bears exploration risk; recovers costs + fee only on success

## 3.3 Comparative Analysis Matrix

### Template 3A: Eight-Dimension Comparison

| Dimension | PSA | Concession | Service Contract |
|-----------|-----|------------|------------------|
| **1. Resource Ownership** | Government retains | IOC acquires (extracted) | Government retains |
| **2. Risk Allocation** | IOC bears exploration risk | IOC bears all risk | Pure: Low; Risk: High |
| **3. Cost Recovery** | Through cost oil | Through tax deductions | Risk: Only if discovery |
| **4. Government Revenue** | Profit oil share + tax + royalty | Royalty + tax | Fee payment only |
| **5. IOC Compensation** | Cost oil + profit oil share | Production - royalty - costs - tax | Fee (+ costs if risk) |
| **6. Operational Control** | Usually IOC (as contractor) | IOC (as license holder) | Government/NOC |
| **7. Asset Transfer** | Immediate or on cost recovery | At license expiry | Immediate |
| **8. Typical Duration** | 20-30 years | 25-40 years | Project-specific |

### Template 3B: Government Take Comparison

| Revenue Source | PSA | Concession | Service Contract |
|----------------|-----|------------|------------------|
| Signature Bonus | Common | Less common | Rare |
| Royalty | Sometimes (before cost oil) | Always (on gross) | N/A |
| Cost Oil | To IOC (capped) | N/A | Risk: If discovery |
| Profit Oil | Government share | N/A | N/A |
| Corporate Tax | On IOC profit oil | On taxable profits | On fee income |
| Special/Windfall Tax | Variable | Common (UK EPL, Norway SPT) | Rare |
| **Typical Total Take** | 60-85% | 40-78% | Lower |

## 3.4 PSA Calculation Framework

### Step-by-Step Calculation Method

**CRITICAL**: This calculation type appears frequently. Master this framework.

#### Step 1: Calculate Gross Revenue
```
Gross Revenue = Production (barrels) x Oil Price ($/barrel)
```

#### Step 2: Deduct Royalty (if applicable)
```
If royalty applies:
Royalty = Gross Revenue x Royalty Rate
Revenue after Royalty = Gross Revenue - Royalty
```

#### Step 3: Calculate Cost Oil
```
Total Recoverable Costs = Opex + Capex (current year)
                        + Unrecovered Costs (brought forward)

If Cost Oil Ceiling applies:
Maximum Cost Oil = (Revenue after Royalty) x Cost Ceiling %
Actual Cost Oil = LOWER OF (Total Recoverable Costs, Maximum Cost Oil)

Unrecovered Costs c/f = Total Recoverable Costs - Actual Cost Oil
```

#### Step 4: Calculate Profit Oil
```
Profit Oil = Revenue after Royalty - Actual Cost Oil

Split:
- Government Profit Oil = Profit Oil x Government %
- IOC Profit Oil = Profit Oil x IOC %
```

#### Step 5: Calculate IOC Tax Liability
```
IOC Taxable Income = IOC Profit Oil - Allowable Deductions
                   (depreciation, operating costs if not in cost oil)

Corporate Tax = IOC Taxable Income x Tax Rate
```

#### Step 6: Calculate IOC Profit After Tax
```
IOC Profit After Tax = IOC Profit Oil - Corporate Tax

OR (depending on question)

IOC Total Returns = Cost Oil + IOC Profit Oil - Corporate Tax
```

### Worked Example: December 2024 Style Question

**Given Data**:
- Signature Bonus: £100,000 (Year 0)
- Pre-production costs: £1,000,000 (recoverable as cost oil)
- Annual production costs: £200,000 (tax deductible)
- Royalty: 10% (in-kind, before profit oil split)
- Profit Oil Split: IOC 40%, Government 60%
- Corporate Tax: 20%
- Fixed Assets: £30m (30-year straight-line depreciation = £1m/year)
- No cost oil ceiling

| Year | Production (bbl) | Price (£) | Calculation Steps |
|------|------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 2021 | 800,000 | 40 | First production year |
| 2022 | 900,000 | 42 | |
| 2023 | 1,000,000 | 44 | |

**Year 2021 Calculation**:

```
1. Gross Revenue = 800,000 x £40 = £32,000,000

2. Royalty (10% in-kind) = 80,000 barrels
   Revenue after royalty = 720,000 x £40 = £28,800,000

3. Cost Oil:
   Pre-production costs b/f = £1,000,000
   No cost ceiling → Full recovery = £1,000,000
   Costs c/f = £0

4. Profit Oil = £28,800,000 - £1,000,000 = £27,800,000
   Government (60%) = £16,680,000
   IOC (40%) = £11,120,000

5. IOC Tax Calculation:
   Profit Oil = £11,120,000
   Less: Depreciation (2 years as 2020 depreciation applies) = £2,000,000
   Less: Production costs = £200,000
   Taxable = £8,920,000
   Tax @ 20% = £1,784,000

6. IOC Profit After Tax = £11,120,000 - £1,784,000 = £9,336,000
   BUT accounting shows: £8,920,000 - £1,784,000 = £7,136,000
```

## 3.5 Templates for Exam Answers

### Template 3C: PSA Structure Answer

**Opening paragraph** (2-3 sentences):
> Under a Production Sharing Agreement, the host government retains ownership of hydrocarbon resources while contracting with an IOC to explore and produce. The IOC bears all pre-production risks and costs, with recovery permitted only upon commercial production through the cost oil mechanism.

**Key features to include** (bullet points):
- Government retains title to reserves in-situ and production
- IOC acts as contractor, bearing exploration and development risk
- Cost recovery through "cost oil" - typically opex first, then capex
- "Profit oil" is the remaining production after cost oil
- Profit oil split according to pre-agreed percentages (fixed or sliding scale)
- IOC pays corporate tax on its share of profit oil
- Government may pay tax on IOC's behalf from its profit oil share
- Assets typically transfer to government upon cost recovery or contract end

**Country examples**: Indonesia (pioneer, 1966), Nigeria (offshore), Angola, Libya, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Guyana

### Template 3D: Concession Structure Answer

**Opening paragraph**:
> Under a concession (or tax/royalty) regime, the host government grants exclusive exploration and production rights over a defined area. Title to extracted hydrocarbons transfers to the concessionaire, who pays royalties on gross production and corporate tax on profits.

**Key features to include**:
- IOC acquires title to extracted oil and gas (not in-situ reserves)
- Long license periods (typically 25-40 years, historically up to 75 years)
- IOC pays all exploration, development and production costs with NO guarantee of recovery
- Royalty paid on gross production regardless of profitability
- Corporate income tax paid on taxable profits after allowable deductions
- Ring-fencing may restrict loss offset between fields
- IOC typically owns assets during license period
- Special petroleum taxes may apply (e.g., UK EPL, Norway SPT)

**Country examples**: UK, Norway (78% government take), USA, Canada, Australia, Brazil

### Template 3E: Service Contract Answer

**Opening paragraph**:
> Service contracts represent arrangements where the host government/NOC engages an IOC to provide technical services for exploration and production. The IOC receives a fee for services rendered, with ownership and operational control remaining with the state.

**Types to distinguish**:

**Pure Service Contract**:
- IOC paid fixed fee regardless of discovery outcome
- Low risk to IOC
- Government bears exploration risk
- Example: Some Kuwait contracts

**Risk Service Contract**:
- IOC recovers costs ONLY if commercial discovery made
- High risk to IOC
- Fee paid in addition to cost recovery upon success
- Examples: Iran (buy-back), Iraq (traditional TSCs), Venezuela

**Country examples**: Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Venezuela, Mexico (historical)

## 3.6 Decision Framework: Which Regime?

### Template 3F: "Recommend a Regime" Framework

**For Host Government seeking to MAXIMISE REVENUE**:

| Factor | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|
| High commodity prices | PSA (captures more through profit oil share) |
| Uncertain reserves | Concession (transfers risk to IOC) |
| Limited technical capacity | PSA or Service Contract (IOC provides expertise) |
| Need for early revenue | Concession (royalty from day one) |
| Political sensitivity | PSA (government retains "ownership" optics) |

**For IOC seeking OPTIMAL RETURNS**:

| Factor | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|
| High exploration risk | Concession (if successful, keeps more upside) |
| Need cost certainty | Service Contract (fee-based) |
| Long-term investment | Concession (clearer ownership rights) |
| Capital constraints | PSA (cost recovery accelerates cash flow) |

### Government Take Analysis Framework

When asked "which regime offers higher revenue":

1. **Calculate total government take under each regime**:
   - PSA: Signature bonus + Royalty + Profit oil share + Tax on IOC profit
   - Concession: Royalty + Corporate tax + Any special taxes

2. **Consider timing**: PSA may delay government revenue (cost oil first)

3. **Consider price scenarios**: PSA typically better at high prices; Concession provides stability

## 3.7 Current Country Examples (2024-2025)

### High Government Take Jurisdictions

| Country | Regime | Government Take | Key Features |
|---------|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Norway** | Concession | ~78% | 22% CIT + 56% Special Tax; no royalty |
| **UK** | Concession | ~78% | 30% CIT + 10% SC + 38% EPL (post-Nov 2024) |
| **Nigeria** | PSA (offshore) | 60-85% | 20%+ royalty, 40%+ PPT, 70%+ cost recovery limit |
| **Indonesia** | PSA (cost recovery or gross split) | 70-85% | Transitioning models; ring-fencing reforms ongoing |

### Recent Developments (for examiner awareness)

- **UK (2024)**: Energy Profits Levy increased to 38%, bringing headline rate to 78%
- **Iraq (2024)**: Moving from Technical Service Contracts to "profit sharing" exploration contracts
- **Guyana**: 50% profit oil split + 2% royalty; 75% cost recovery ceiling
- **Indonesia**: Debating cost recovery vs gross split PSC models

## 3.8 Common Errors to Avoid

### Calculation Errors

| Error | Correction |
|-------|------------|
| Forgetting cost oil ceiling | Always check if ceiling applies before calculating cost oil |
| Applying royalty to profit oil | Royalty typically on GROSS revenue, before cost oil |
| Double-counting depreciation | Clarify if depreciation is in cost oil OR tax calculation |
| Ignoring brought-forward costs | Unrecovered costs carry forward to next period |
| Signature bonus in cost oil | Usually NOT recoverable as cost oil |

### Conceptual Errors

| Error | Correction |
|-------|------------|
| "IOC owns resources under PSA" | Government ALWAYS retains ownership under PSA |
| "No tax under PSA" | IOC pays corporate tax on its profit oil share |
| "Royalty only in concessions" | Some PSAs also have royalty (before cost/profit split) |
| "Service contracts = no risk" | RISK service contracts carry significant IOC risk |
| Confusing cost oil with profit oil | Cost oil = recovery; Profit oil = what's left after |

### Structure Errors

| Error | Correction |
|-------|------------|
| Not answering all parts | Check mark allocation; address each requirement |
| Pure theory without examples | Always include 2-3 country examples |
| Calculation without explanation | Show workings AND explain the logic |
| Missing comparative element | Question asks "differences" - ensure you compare directly |

## 3.10 Practice Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Comparison Question (June 2023 style)
> "Discuss the principal characteristics and structures of production sharing agreements, and identify the key differences between this regime and the concession and service contract regimes." (25 marks)

**Approach**: Allocate ~15 marks to PSA discussion, ~5 marks each to concession and service contract comparison. Use Template 3C for PSA, then Template 3A comparison matrix.

### Scenario 2: Calculation Question (December 2024 style)
> Given: PSA with royalty 10%, profit split 40/60, tax 20%, cost ceiling 50%, multi-year production data.
> "Calculate (1) IOC profits after tax; (2) Government revenues."

**Approach**: Use Section 3.4 framework. Year-by-year calculation. Remember cost ceiling. Show government revenue breakdown (royalty + profit oil + tax).

### Scenario 3: Advisory Question (June 2025 style)
> "Advise Country X on the key features of concession agreements and PSAs. Explain which form of agreement would likely offer the highest overall revenue."

**Approach**: Use Templates 3D and 3C for features. Apply Template 3F decision framework. Calculate if data provided, otherwise qualitative analysis of factors.

## Summary: Key Points for 25-Mark Success

1. **PSA Essence**: Government owns resources; IOC is contractor; cost oil recovery then profit oil split; IOC pays tax on its share

2. **Concession Essence**: IOC acquires title to extracted resources; pays royalty + tax; bears full risk with no recovery guarantee

3. **Service Contract Essence**: IOC provides services for fee; Pure (guaranteed) vs Risk (contingent on discovery)

4. **Government Take**: PSA typically higher at high prices; Concession provides earlier stable revenue

5. **Calculation Keys**: Cost oil ceiling, royalty timing, depreciation treatment, brought-forward costs

6. **Country Examples**: Know 2-3 for each regime (Indonesia/Nigeria/Guyana for PSA; UK/Norway/USA for Concession; Iraq/Iran/Kuwait for Service)

7. **Always Compare**: Use structured comparison, not just description of each regime separately
