## 10.2 CORE KNOWLEDGE BANK

### 10.2.1 Objectives of Tax Treaties in Oil & Gas

**Primary Objectives**:

| Objective | How It Applies to Oil & Gas |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| **Eliminate double taxation** | Prevents same income being taxed in source country AND residence country |
| **Allocate taxing rights** | Determines which country taxes what income (production, services, gains) |
| **Reduce withholding taxes** | Lowers WHT on dividends, interest, royalties flowing from operations |
| **Encourage cross-border investment** | Provides certainty for capital-intensive upstream investments |
| **Prevent tax evasion** | Information exchange, anti-abuse provisions |

**Why Treaties Matter for Oil & Gas** (from December 2024 exam):

1. **High capital intensity** - Projects require billions in investment; treaty certainty reduces risk premium
2. **Long project lifecycles** - 20-40 year horizons need stable tax treatment
3. **Complex structures** - Multiple entities, jurisdictions, income types
4. **Significant cross-border payments** - Management fees, technical services, interest, dividends
5. **Asset transfers** - Farm-ins, farm-outs, license sales all engage treaty provisions

### 10.2.2 Key Treaty Articles for Oil & Gas

| Article | Subject | Oil & Gas Relevance |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| **Article 4** | Residence | Determines treaty entitlement |
| **Article 5** | Permanent Establishment | Threshold for source taxation |
| **Article 7** | Business Profits | Taxation of PE profits |
| **Article 10** | Dividends | WHT on profit repatriation |
| **Article 11** | Interest | WHT on debt financing |
| **Article 12** | Royalties | WHT on IP, technical know-how |
| **Article 12A** | Technical Services (UN) | Source taxation of service fees |
| **Article 13** | Capital Gains | Taxation of asset/share disposals |
| **Article 21** | Other Income | Residual category |
| **Article 23** | Relief Methods | Credit vs exemption |

## 10.3 CAPITAL GAINS AND TAX TREATIES

### 10.3.1 Article 13 Structure

**Article 13 Hierarchy** (apply in order):

```
ARTICLE 13 CAPITAL GAINS - DECISION TREE

Step 1: Is the gain from immovable property?
        │
        ├── YES → Article 13(1): Source country MAY tax
        │         (includes oil & gas licenses in most countries)
        │
        └── NO → Continue to Step 2

Step 2: Is the gain from movable property of a PE?
        │
        ├── YES → Article 13(2): Source country MAY tax
        │         (equipment, inventory attributed to PE)
        │
        └── NO → Continue to Step 3

Step 3: Is the gain from ships/aircraft in international traffic?
        │
        ├── YES → Article 13(3): Residence country only
        │
        └── NO → Continue to Step 4

Step 4: Is the gain from shares deriving >50% value from
        immovable property? [Article 13(4)]
        │
        ├── YES → Source country MAY tax
        │         (KEY PROVISION for oil & gas share deals)
        │
        └── NO → Continue to Step 5

Step 5: All other gains
        │
        └── Article 13(5): Residence country ONLY
            (default rule)
```

### 10.3.2 Immovable Property in Oil & Gas Context

**What Qualifies as Immovable Property?**

| Asset Type | Classification | Treaty Treatment |
|------------|---------------|------------------|
| Oil & gas reserves in ground | Immovable | Source can tax |
| Production licenses/concessions | Usually immovable | Source can tax |
| PSC contractual rights | Depends on domestic law | Analyze carefully |
| Pipelines (permanent) | Immovable | Source can tax |
| Offshore platforms (fixed) | Usually immovable | Source can tax |
| FPSOs (floating) | May be movable | Depends on permanence |
| Drilling equipment | Movable | Different rules |

**Key Principle**: Most oil & gas licenses are treated as interests in immovable property under domestic law, bringing them within Article 13(1) or 13(4).

### 10.3.3 The 50% Immovable Property Rule - Article 13(4)

**Critical Provision for Share Disposals** (from June 2025 exam):

```
ARTICLE 13(4) ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

Question: Can source country tax gain on sale of shares in
          company holding oil & gas assets?

Test: Do shares derive MORE THAN 50% of their value from
      immovable property in source country?

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CALCULATION:                                                     │
│                                                                  │
│ Value from immovable property in Country X                      │
│ ─────────────────────────────────────────── > 50%?              │
│ Total value of shares                                           │
│                                                                  │
│ If YES → Country X (source) MAY tax the capital gain           │
│ If NO  → Only residence country taxes (Article 13(5))          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

WHAT COUNTS AS "VALUE"?
• Oil & gas reserves (proved + probable)
• License/concession rights
• Production facilities
• Pipelines and infrastructure
• Land and buildings

WHAT DOESN'T COUNT:
• Cash and receivables
• Equipment (movable)
• Goodwill (separate from immovable)
• Value from other countries
```

**Timing Issues**:
- Test applied at time of disposal
- Some treaties: "at any time during 365 days before disposal"
- Depleting assets may fall below 50% over time
- Planning opportunity: time disposal after significant depletion

### 10.3.4 Indirect Transfers

**The Problem**: Seller structures disposal as sale of shares in intermediate holding company rather than direct asset sale to avoid source country CGT.

```
INDIRECT TRANSFER STRUCTURE

BEFORE:                           AFTER:

Parent Co (Country A)             Parent Co sells HoldCo shares
    │                             to Buyer - gain realized in
    ▼                             Country A (residence)
HoldCo (Country B)
    │                             Country X (source) loses
    ▼                             taxing rights if:
OpCo (Country X)                  - No treaty Art 13(4), OR
    │                             - HoldCo has diversified assets
    ▼
Oil & Gas Assets
```

**Treaty Responses**:

| Approach | Mechanism | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Article 13(4)** | Source can tax if >50% immovable | OECD/UN Models |
| **Look-through** | Treat as direct disposal | India, Indonesia |
| **Domestic law override** | Unilateral source taxation | Many developing countries |
| **Treaty anti-avoidance** | PPT denies benefit | Post-BEPS treaties |

**Exam Application** (from June 2024 Q4):
When analyzing license transfer structures, always consider:
1. Direct transfer → Article 13(1) applies, source taxes
2. Share transfer → Apply Article 13(4) test
3. Indirect transfer → Check for look-through rules
4. Treaty shopping → Apply PPT/LOB analysis

## 10.4 WITHHOLDING TAXES AND TREATIES

### 10.4.1 Overview of WHT in Oil & Gas Structures

**Common Cross-Border Payments Subject to WHT**:

| Payment Type | Treaty Article | Typical Domestic Rate | Treaty Rate |
|--------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Dividends | Article 10 | 15-30% | 5-15% |
| Interest | Article 11 | 10-25% | 0-10% |
| Royalties | Article 12 | 10-25% | 0-10% |
| Technical service fees | Article 12A (UN) | 10-25% | 10-15% |
| Management fees | Article 7/12A | 10-25% | Varies |

### 10.4.2 Dividends - Article 10

**Treaty Rate Structure** (from December 2024 exam):

```
DIVIDEND WHT UNDER TREATIES

Typical Treaty Provision:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Ownership Threshold    │ WHT Rate                               │
├────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ≥25% direct holding    │ 5% (reduced rate for substantial      │
│                        │ participations)                        │
├────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ <25% holding           │ 15% (portfolio rate)                  │
└────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────┘

OIL & GAS CONSIDERATIONS:
• JV partners often hold 20-40% → May qualify for reduced rate
• Holding company structures → Check beneficial ownership
• Participation exemption in residence country → May eliminate
  economic double taxation even with WHT
```

**Planning Point**: Many oil & gas groups use Netherlands, Luxembourg, or UK holding companies for dividend flows due to:
- Extensive treaty networks
- Participation exemptions
- Low/nil WHT on outbound dividends

### 10.4.3 Interest - Article 11

**Relevance to Oil & Gas Financing** (from December 2024 exam):

```
INTEREST WHT ANALYSIS

Scenario: Parent lends $500M to subsidiary for field development

WITHOUT TREATY:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Interest payment (10% p.a.)           $50,000,000               │
│ Domestic WHT @ 25%                   ($12,500,000)              │
│ Net receipt                          $37,500,000               │
│                                                                  │
│ Cash leakage on interest: $12.5M annually                       │
│ Over 10-year loan: $125M total WHT                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

WITH TREATY (10% WHT rate):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Interest payment                      $50,000,000               │
│ Treaty WHT @ 10%                      ($5,000,000)              │
│ Net receipt                          $45,000,000               │
│                                                                  │
│ Cash saving vs no treaty: $7.5M annually                       │
│ Over 10-year loan: $75M total saving                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

SOME TREATIES PROVIDE 0% ON INTEREST:
• UK-USA: 0% on interest
• Netherlands treaties: Often 0%
• Financing through treaty-favorable jurisdiction critical
```

**Tax Gross-Up Clauses** (exam favorite):

Purpose: Protect lender from WHT burden by requiring borrower to "gross up" payment.

```
GROSS-UP CALCULATION

Lender requires $50M net interest
Source country WHT: 25%

WITHOUT GROSS-UP:
Borrower pays: $50M
WHT deducted: $12.5M
Lender receives: $37.5M ← Shortfall

WITH GROSS-UP:
Required net: $50M
Gross-up formula: $50M ÷ (1 - 0.25) = $66.67M
WHT @ 25%: $16.67M
Lender receives: $50M ← Protected

COST TO BORROWER: Additional $16.67M payment
This is why treaty planning is critical for project financing
```

### 10.4.4 Royalties - Article 12

**Types of Royalties in Oil & Gas**:

| Payment | Classification | Treaty Treatment |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| Technology license fees | Royalty | Article 12 |
| Seismic data licensing | Royalty | Article 12 |
| Software licensing | Royalty/Service | Depends on nature |
| Know-how payments | Royalty | Article 12 |
| Equipment rental | NOT royalty | Article 7 or Other |

**OECD vs UN Treatment**:
- **OECD Model**: Royalties taxable ONLY in residence country (0% source WHT)
- **UN Model**: Source country MAY tax at agreed rate (typically 10-15%)

Most oil-producing countries follow UN approach to preserve source taxation.

---

## 10.5 ANTI-AVOIDANCE AND TREATY BENEFITS

### 10.5.1 Principal Purpose Test (PPT) - BEPS Action 6

**The Standard** (post-2017 treaties):

> Treaty benefits shall NOT be granted if it is reasonable to conclude that obtaining that benefit was ONE OF the principal purposes of the arrangement.

```
PPT ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

Step 1: Identify the benefit claimed
        • Reduced WHT rate
        • Capital gains exemption
        • PE threshold protection

Step 2: Examine the arrangement
        • Holding company structure
        • Financing route
        • Timing of transactions

Step 3: Apply the "reasonable to conclude" test
        • Would a reasonable person conclude tax benefit
          was a principal purpose?
        • Not sole purpose - just ONE OF principal purposes

Step 4: Consider objective evidence
        • Commercial rationale
        • Substance in jurisdiction
        • Pre-existing structure vs. new arrangement
        • Timing relative to transaction

RESULT:
• If PPT applies → Benefit DENIED
• If genuine commercial purpose → Benefit AVAILABLE
```

### 10.5.2 Limitation on Benefits (LOB) - US Treaty Style

**Components of Typical LOB Clause**:

```
LOB CLAUSE STRUCTURE

To claim treaty benefits, entity must satisfy ONE of:

□ Qualified Person Tests:
  □ Individual resident
  □ Government/governmental entity
  □ Publicly traded company (and subsidiaries)
  □ Tax-exempt organization
  □ Ownership/base erosion test:
    - >50% owned by qualified persons, AND
    - <50% of income paid to non-qualified persons

□ Active Trade or Business Test:
  □ Engaged in substantial business in treaty country
  □ Income derived in connection with that business
  □ Not merely investment/passive holding

□ Derivative Benefits Test:
  □ Owned by persons entitled to equivalent benefits
  □ Under their own country's treaty

□ Headquarters Company Test:
  □ Principal management and control functions
  □ For group operating in multiple countries

□ Discretionary Relief:
  □ Competent authority determination
  □ Case-by-case basis
```

**Oil & Gas Application**:
- Holding companies must show SUBSTANCE
- Regional headquarters may qualify under HQ test
- Pure "letterbox" companies will fail LOB
- Consider derivative benefits if owner's country has equivalent treaty

### 10.5.3 Beneficial Ownership Requirement

**The Test**: Treaty benefits only available to "beneficial owner" of income.

```
BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP ANALYSIS

Question: Is the recipient the BENEFICIAL OWNER?

INDICATORS OF BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP:
✓ Has full right to use and enjoy the income
✓ Not obligated to pass income to another person
✓ Bears economic risk of the investment
✓ Has substantive decision-making authority
✓ Not acting as agent, nominee, or conduit

INDICATORS OF LACK OF BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP:
✗ Contractual obligation to on-pay income
✗ Back-to-back arrangements
✗ No economic substance
✗ Pre-arranged circular flows
✗ Acting under direction of another party

COMMON STRUCTURES CHALLENGED:
• Conduit financing arrangements
• Treaty shopping through interposed entities
• Back-to-back loans
• Nominee shareholdings

## 10.7 WORKED EXAMPLES FROM PAST PAPERS

### Example 1: Role of Tax Treaties in Oil & Gas (December 2024 Q2 Style - 25 marks)

**Question Pattern**: "Discuss the role of tax treaties in the oil and gas industry, covering financing, capital gains, and withholding taxes"

**Model Answer Structure**:

```
PART A: TREATY OBJECTIVES IN OIL & GAS (8 marks)

1. ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION
   • Oil & gas income potentially taxed in:
     - Source country (where operations occur)
     - Residence country (where parent located)
   • Without treaty: Same profits taxed twice
   • Treaty allocates taxing rights, provides relief

2. ENCOURAGING CROSS-BORDER INVESTMENT
   • Oil & gas: Capital intensive ($bn projects)
   • Long payback periods (20-40 years)
   • Treaty certainty reduces risk premium
   • Stable WHT rates enable financial modeling

3. REDUCING WITHHOLDING TAXES
   • Cross-border payments common:
     - Dividends to shareholders
     - Interest on project financing
     - Royalties for technology
     - Management/technical service fees
   • Treaty rates typically 5-15% vs 25-30% domestic

4. PREVENTING TAX EVASION
   • Information exchange provisions
   • Anti-abuse rules (PPT, LOB)
   • Transparent reporting requirements

PART B: FINANCING CONSIDERATIONS (8 marks)

1. DEBT vs EQUITY DECISION
   ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ Factor           │ Debt Financing │ Equity Financing  │
   ├──────────────────┼────────────────┼───────────────────┤
   │ Deductibility    │ Interest       │ Not deductible    │
   │                  │ deductible     │                   │
   │ WHT (without     │ 10-25%         │ 15-30%            │
   │ treaty)          │                │                   │
   │ WHT (with        │ 0-10%          │ 5-15%             │
   │ treaty)          │                │                   │
   │ Repatriation     │ Fixed          │ Flexible          │
   │ flexibility      │ schedule       │                   │
   │ Thin cap risk    │ Yes            │ No                │
   └──────────────────┴────────────────┴───────────────────┘

2. TAX GROSS-UP CLAUSES
   • Protect lender from WHT erosion
   • Borrower bears additional cost
   • Example: To deliver $100 net at 20% WHT:
     Gross payment = $100 ÷ 0.80 = $125
     WHT = $25, Net = $100
   • Treaty reduction critical to project economics

3. TREATY PLANNING FOR FINANCING
   • Route debt through favorable treaty jurisdiction
   • Ensure beneficial ownership substance
   • Consider hybrid instruments (debt/equity)
   • Watch for BEPS Action 2 (hybrids) implications

PART C: CAPITAL GAINS TAXATION (5 marks)

1. DIRECT ASSET TRANSFERS
   • Sale of license/concession = Article 13(1)
   • Immovable property → Source country taxes
   • No treaty relief typically available

2. SHARE TRANSFERS - THE 50% TEST
   • Article 13(4): Source can tax if shares derive
     >50% value from immovable property
   • Oil & gas shares almost always >50% immovable
   • Planning: Consider timing (depletion reduces %)

3. INDIRECT TRANSFERS
   • Sale of intermediate holding company shares
   • Treaty may not protect if look-through applies
   • Increasing domestic law overrides

PART D: WHT CHALLENGES AND PLANNING (4 marks)

1. COMMON CHALLENGES
   • Treaty shopping scrutiny
   • Beneficial ownership challenges
   • PPT/LOB denials
   • Substance requirements increasing

2. PLANNING STRATEGIES
   • Build genuine substance in treaty jurisdictions
   • Document commercial rationale
   • Consider regional headquarters structures
   • Monitor treaty network changes

### Example 2: Capital Gains Treaty Analysis (June 2025 Q4 Style - 20 marks)

**Question Pattern**: "Analyze the capital gains tax implications of disposing of oil and gas assets, considering domestic law and treaty positions"

**Model Answer**:

```
CAPITAL GAINS ANALYSIS - OIL & GAS DISPOSAL

SCENARIO SETUP:
• ParentCo (Country A) owns 100% of SubCo (Country X)
• SubCo holds petroleum license worth $500M
• Potential buyer offers $600M for either:
  Option 1: Direct license purchase from SubCo
  Option 2: Share purchase of SubCo from ParentCo

OPTION 1: DIRECT LICENSE SALE

Domestic Law (Country X):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│                                                                 │
│ CGT @ 30%                                  $150,000,000         │
│                                                                 │
│ SubCo receives net:                        $450,000,000         │
│ (before dividend to ParentCo)                                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Treaty Position:
• Article 13(1): Gains from immovable property
• Petroleum license = immovable property
• Country X (source) HAS RIGHT TO TAX
• Treaty does NOT reduce CGT on direct sale
• Relief: ParentCo claims credit in Country A

OPTION 2: SHARE SALE

Step 1: Apply Article 13(4) Test

CONCLUSION:
Under Article 13(4), share sale offers NO tax advantage where
>50% of value derives from immovable property. Consider:
• Buyer's preference (asset vs share deal)
• Historic tax liabilities in SubCo
• Stamp duty differences
• Simplicity of transaction

### Example 3: WHT and Treaty Planning (December 2024 Style)

**Question Pattern**: "Evaluate the withholding tax implications of cross-border payments in oil and gas operations"

**Model Answer**:

```
WHT ANALYSIS - CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS

SCENARIO:
OilCo (Netherlands) owns SubCo (Country X - developing country)
Annual payments from SubCo to OilCo:
• Dividends: $50M
• Interest on shareholder loan: $30M
• Technical services fees: $20M
• Royalties (technology): $10M

*If treaty follows UN Model with Article 12A

ANNUAL SAVING: $14.6 MILLION

REQUIREMENTS TO CLAIM TREATY BENEFITS:

1. Residence Certificate
   • OilCo must obtain Dutch tax residence certificate
   • Annually renewed

2. Beneficial Ownership
   • OilCo must be beneficial owner of all payments
   • Not acting as conduit to third country
   • Must have substance in Netherlands:
     - Local board meetings
     - Employees/management
     - Decision-making authority

3. Anti-Avoidance Compliance
   • PPT: Structure must have non-tax purpose
   • Document commercial rationale for Netherlands HQ
   • Active management of SubCo operations

4. Procedural Compliance
   • File treaty benefit claims with Country X
   • Maintain documentation for audit
   • Report payments correctly

RISKS TO MONITOR:

1. Beneficial ownership challenge if:
   • OilCo immediately on-pays to ultimate parent
   • Minimal substance in Netherlands
   • Back-to-back arrangements

2. PPT denial if:
   • Netherlands structure created primarily for treaty
   • No genuine commercial rationale
   • Minimal management activities

3. Domestic law changes:
   • Country X may amend treaties
   • Unilateral source taxation rules emerging
   • BEPS-driven treaty modifications

## 10.8 CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS

### 10.8.1 BEPS 2.0 - Pillar Two Implications for Oil & Gas

**Global Minimum Tax (15%)**:

| Element | Impact on Oil & Gas |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Scope** | MNEs with revenue >€750M (most major IOCs) |
| **Minimum rate** | 15% effective tax rate per jurisdiction |
| **Top-up tax** | If ETR <15%, parent country collects difference |
| **Substance carve-out** | 5% of payroll + 5% of tangible assets excluded |

**Oil & Gas Considerations**:
- High tangible asset base → Larger substance carve-out
- Production country taxes typically >15% → Limited direct impact
- Low-tax holding structures may face top-up
- Royalty/license fee structures under scrutiny

### 10.8.2 Subject to Tax Rule (STTR)

**New Development** (2024): Multilateral treaty to implement STTR.

```
STTR OVERVIEW

Purpose: Ensure minimum 9% tax on certain payments

Covered Payments:
• Interest
• Royalties
• Fees for services (in some versions)

Mechanism:
If payment taxed at <9% in recipient country:
→ Source country may apply additional WHT
→ Up to difference between actual rate and 9%

Example:
• Interest paid to entity in 0% tax jurisdiction
• Normal treaty WHT: 0%
• Under STTR: Source can apply up to 9% WHT

Oil & Gas Impact:
• Financing through tax havens less attractive
• Need to reconsider treasury structures
• Legitimate low-tax jurisdictions affected
```

### 10.8.3 UN Tax Developments

**2024 UN Framework Convention**:
- Greater emphasis on source country taxation
- Article 12A expansion (technical services)
- Developing country coalition pushing for change
- May result in broader source taxation rights

---

## 10.9 ERROR PREVENTION

### Common Exam Mistakes

| Error | Why It's Wrong | Correct Approach |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| Assuming treaty always reduces tax | Treaties allocate rights; may not reduce CGT | Analyze each article separately |
| Forgetting Article 13(4) | Share sales often caught by 50% rule | Always apply immovable property test |
| Ignoring beneficial ownership | Treaty benefits denied without substance | Address substance in every answer |
| Confusing OECD and UN models | Different source rights | State which model applies |
| Missing PPT analysis | Modern treaties include anti-abuse | Always consider if benefits genuine |
| Applying wrong article | Income must be correctly characterized | Use Template 10B hierarchy |
| Forgetting gross-up implications | WHT affects project economics | Calculate true cost including gross-up |

## 10.11 CHAPTER SUMMARY

### Key Takeaways

1. **Tax treaties** are critical for oil & gas due to high capital intensity and cross-border payments
2. **Article 13(4)** often allows source taxation on share sales where >50% value from immovable property
3. **WHT reduction** on dividends, interest, royalties provides significant cash flow benefits
4. **Beneficial ownership** and **substance** requirements are essential for treaty claims
5. **PPT and LOB** provisions can deny treaty benefits if structure lacks commercial rationale
6. **OECD vs UN models** differ significantly on source country rights
7. **Pillar Two** (15% minimum tax) and **STTR** are reshaping international tax landscape
